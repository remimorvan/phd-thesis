		This preliminary chapter briefly surveys the literature on
		the notion of \emph{conjunctive queries},
		\emph{conjunctive regular path queries} and related notions.
		We start by presenting the notion of "duality@@CQ" for "conjunctive queries",
		and how it can be used for the \emph{static analysis} of this language.
		We then turn to the more complex language of "conjunctive regular path queries"
		designed for "graph databases", which will be the focus of the rest of this part
		of the thesis.
