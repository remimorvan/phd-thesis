\section{Minimization Problems}

Rather than closing the complexity gaps between our "$k$-ExpSpace" upper bounds
and the "ExpSpace" lower bounds in the decision problems
studied in \Cref{ch:minimization-CRPQ,ch:semantic-tree-width-CRPQ},
we believe that the most interesting questions "wrt" to minimization
are actually those related to \emph{structure}, and more precisely those that try to
connect the different notions of minimality together.

\conjAtomVariableMinimal*

\paragraph*{Minimization \& Trees.}
The question of whether the seminal results of \cite{CzerwinskiMartensNiewerthParys2018Minimization} could be lifted from "tree patterns"
to their encoding as "CRPQs" remain open.
\conjTreePatternsAsCRPQs*

On a similar note, an interesting question is whether two goals
("eg" the number of variables and the number of "atoms")
can be simultaneously minimized.
For "CQs", this is always the case by \Cref{prop:minimization-CQ}. However, this question
seems quite hard for "CRPQs", even on concrete examples.
We say that a "CRPQ" is ""forest-shaped"" if its underlying "directed graph"
is a "disjoint union" of "directed trees".
\begin{question}
	Is it the case that every "Boolean CRPQ" that is (1) "equivalent@@sem" to
	a "forest-shaped" "CRPQ" and (2) "equivalent@@sem" to a "CRPQ"
  with at most $k$ "atoms" is necessarily "equivalent@@sem" to a 
  "forest-shaped" "CRPQ" with at most $k$ "atoms"?
\end{question}
We conjecture the answer to this question to be yes, but we were unable to prove it:
we only managed to prove that, under these assumptions, the query
should be "equivalent@@sem" to a "forest-shaped" "CRPQ" with at most $2^k$ "atoms"
(\Cref{thm:charac-semantically-forest-shaped}).


\paragraph*{Maximal Under-Approximations.}
Both the result on "UCRPQ minimization" of \Cref{ch:minimization-CRPQ}
and of "semantic tree-width" minimization of \Cref{ch:semantic-tree-width-CRPQ} 
rely on the existence---and computability---of "maximal under-approximations".
In the first case, the target class consists of finitely many graphs (\Cref{lemma:approximation-for-finclass}), but in the second case,
it is infinite (\Cref{lemma:bound_size_refinements}): as such the proof is significantly harder.
Having the remarkable genericity of \Cref{prop:minimization-CQ} in mind,
we could only hope to be able to capture 
both \Cref{lemma:approximation-for-finclass,lemma:bound_size_refinements}.

\begin{question}
	Given a class $\+C$ of "graphs@@dir" that is "closed under minors",
	do "maximal under-approximations" by "UC(2)RPQs" over $\+C$ always exist?
	If so, are they computable?
\end{question}

\section{Profinite Databases}

\end{marginfigure}
As we have seen in \Cref{sec:prelim-db-relational}, "duality"---namely the existence of
a dual "isomorphism" between queries and models---provides a remarkable framework to
study "conjunctive queries". For the more complex language of "conjunctive regular path queries",
however, this isomorphism fails, making static analysis much harder.
We thought that part of the enjoyable properties of "conjunctive queries"
could be recovered for "CRPQs" by considering the notion of "profinite databases".
In short, a \AP""profinite database"" consists of, a ``projective system'' of finite "graph databases",
"ie" an $\omega$-sequence of "homomorphisms"
\[
	\?G_0 \cohomto \?G_1 \cohomto \dotsc \cohomto \?G_n \cohomto \?G_{n+1} \cohomto \dotsc
\]
that we denote by $\varprojlim\limits_{n\in\N} \?G_n$.

\smallskip

A typical example of such a system can be obtained as follows:
just like we did in \Cref{sec:prelim-db-relational},
we let $\?C_n$ ($n\in\Np$) denote the directed cycle with domain $\ZnZ{n}$
and with an edge from $i$ to $j$ "iff" $i+1 = j$, see \Cref{fig:conclu-db-cycles}.
Recall that $\?C_n \homto \?C_m$ "iff" $n$ is a multiple of $m$.
In particular, we have
\[
	\?C_1 \cohomto \?C_2 \cohomto \dotsc \cohomto \?C_{2^n} \cohomto \?C_{2^{n+1}} \cohomto \dotsc.
\]

			\node[vertex, draw=c\j, fill=c\j, fill opacity=.4] (s\i) at (\i*360/6: 1.2cm) {};
		}
		\foreach \i in {0,...,5} {
			\pgfmathtruncatemacro\ip{mod(\i+1, 6)}
			\draw[edge] (s\i) to (s\ip);
		}

		\foreach \i in {0,1,2} {
			\node[vertex, draw=c\i, fill=c\i, fill opacity=.4] (t\i) at ($(\i*360/3: .9cm)+(5, 0)$) {};
		}
		\foreach \i in {0,1,2} {
			\pgfmathtruncatemacro\ip{mod(\i+1, 3)}
			\draw[edge] (t\i) to (t\ip);
		}
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{\AP\label{fig:conclu-db-cycles} The "graphs@@dir" $\?C_6$
	(left) and $\?C_3$ (right) and a "homomorphism" from the former
	to the latter, described by colour coding. (Replica of \Cref{fig:prelim-db-cycles}.)}
\end{figure}

The crucial point is that projective system have a natural semantics:
we define the semantics of \[\varprojlim\limits_{n\in\N} \?G_n\]
as the set of points that above some element of this sequence,
"ie" as
\[
	\?H \vDash \semFO{\varprojlim\limits_{n\in\N} \?G_n}
	\quad\text{when}\quad
	\exists n.\; \?G_n \homto \?H.
\]
For instance
\[\varprojlim\limits_{n\in\N} \?C_{2^n}\] has a simple
semantical interpretation:
letting $\?G$ be a "graph database", for any $n\in\N$, we get that $\?C_{2^n} \homto \?G$
if, and only if, $\?G$ contains a "directed cycle" of length $2^n$.
And so, there exists $n\in\N$ "st" $\?C_{2^n} \homto \?G$ if, and only if, $\?G$ contains
a "directed cycle" whose length is a power of 2.
In fact the true definition of projective system allows the sequence to
be indexed by a directed set rather than $\N$: in the case we would obtain
an object \[\varprojlim\limits_{n\in\tup{\Np,\mid}} \?C_{n},\] where we order $\Np$ by divisibility,
and whose semantics is ``the database contains a directed cycle''!

\paragraph{How Profinite Databases Arise.}
Profinite models naturally arise
by considering Stone duality. Roughly, Stone duality is a theory that,
starting from a logic and its models, adds new idealized/abstract models which
are necessary to make the theory compact, well-behaved and nicely describable.
For instance, applied to first-order logic over all structures,
this construction does nothing! This is precisely because this logic is already
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compactness\_theorem}{compact}.
On the other hand, when applied to "regular languages" of finite words,
we obtained profinite words, which are exactly the models needed to describe
"pseudovarieties of monoids"! We refer the reader to \cite{GehrkeGool2024Topological}
for a not so short survey of the topic.

Second, "profinite databases" naturally appear when dealing with the semantics
of "CRPQs".%
\footnote{They actually are at the heart of
the proof of \Cref{thm:charac-semantically-forest-shaped}!}
Indeed, let $\gamma()$ and $\delta()$ be "CRPQs",
and assume that $\gamma() \semequiv \delta()$. Over "CQs", it would mean that
their "core@@CQ" are "isomorphic" (by \Cref{prop:equiv-core-isomorphic} and "duality"),
but over "CRPQs", we do not have such a nice characterization.
However, pick a "canonical database" $\?G_0 \cdb \gamma$. From the
fact that $\gamma \contained \delta$, we get the existence of $\?D_0 \cdb \delta$
"st" $\?G_0 \cohomto \?D_0$. In turn, using the converse "containment" $\delta \contained \gamma$,
we get that there exists $\?G_1 \cdb \gamma_1$ "st" $\?D_0 \cohomto \?G_1$. By induction,
we obtain an infinite sequence
\[
	\?G_0 \cohomto \?D_0 \cohomto \dotsc. \cohomto \?G_n \cohomto \?D_n \cohomto
	\?G_{n+1} \cohomto \?D_{n+1} \cohomto \dotsc.
\]
In other words, we get that the "profinite databases"
\[\varprojlim_{n\in\N} \?G_{n}
\quad\text{and}\quad
\varprojlim_{n\in\N} \?D_{n}\]
are "semantically equivalent"!

\end{figure}

\paragraph{What Profinite Databases Could Help Us Achieve.}
In the previous chapters, we presented two results that where conditional
to the existence of "hom-minimal expansions":
\begin{itemize}
	\item the "semantical structure theorem" (\Cref{thm:structure-theorem}), which
		provides lower bounds on the complexity required to express a "CRPQ"---and which is,
		to out knowledge, actually the only result of this form for "CRPQs";
	\item a very partial generalization of "Grohe's theorem" to
		"finitely-redundant" Boolean "UC2RPQs" (\Cref{thm:tractability-finred}).
\end{itemize}
However, a very simple "CRPQ" such as $\gamma() \defeq x \atom{\A^*} x$,
expressing that the "database@@graph" contains "directed cycle" no do not
have "hom-minimal expansions", but it does have a "hom-minimal" 
"profinite database", which is \[\varprojlim\limits_{n\in\tup{\Np,\mid}} \?C_{n}.\]
More generally, by Zorn's lemma, every "CRPQ" admits at least 
one "hom-minimal" "profinite database", see \Cref{fig:poset-reldb-profinite}!

\begin{question}
	Can we generalize \Cref{thm:structure-theorem,thm:tractability-finred}
	to handle "hom-minimal" "profinite databases" rather than
	"hom-minimal" "finite databases"?
\end{question}

A positive answer to this question would provide a necessary and sufficient condition
on all "CRPQs" to be expressibly by simple "CRPQs", and might
lead to a characterization of tractable classes of "CRPQs"---which are results we can only dream of
given our current knowledge.

\end{marginfigure}
One the positive side, we managed to prove---in an unpublished work with Sam van Gool---that
the Stone dual of the Heyting algebra of "conjunctive queries" is isomorphic
to the space of "profinite databases", which seems to point towards the fact
that "profinite databases" are natural objects.

On the negative side, we do not know what to do with this result…
One of the main difficulties however is to find a reasonable definition for the notion of
``$\+C$-profinite databases''. We would like this notion to be defined at least whenever $\+C$ is a "minor-closed" "class of CRPQs", and intuitively $\+C$-profinite databases should
generalize the $\+C$-finite databases.
For instance, for "tree-width", we might have that "homomorphisms"
\[
	\?G \cohomto \?D \cohomto \?G'
\]
where $\?G$ and $\?G'$ have "tree-width" at most $k$,
but where $\?D$ is nowhere having "semantic tree-width" at most $k$…
More abstractly: "homomorphisms" do not interact that well with the notion of "minor".%
\footnote{This contrasts with the fact that "minor-closed classes" are closed under taking "cores".}
