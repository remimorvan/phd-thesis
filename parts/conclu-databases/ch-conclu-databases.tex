% Extend the notion of `strong minimality` using the axioms used in the lower bound (`str-onto`): call such canonical databases / extensions `structurally minimal'.
% Prove or disprove the following result: ``a CRPQ has one-way semantic tree-width at least $k$ "iff" it has an expansion that is structurally minimal and whose core has tree-width at least $k$''. In general: what about minor-closed classes?
% Extend Grohe's Theorem to CRPQs (or maybe to a subclass of CRPQs, "eg" those whose
% structurally minimal canonical databases characterize membership to minor-closed classes).
