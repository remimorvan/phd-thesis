\chapter{Finite-Word Relations and Automatic Structures}

	\begin{abstract}
		This preliminary chapter surveys the literature on
		the notion of \emph{rationality} for finite word relations and
		"automatic structures".

		We start by reviewing competing definitions of rationality for $k$-ary
		relations of finite words ($k \geq 2$).
		We survey the corresponding hierarchy, which is mainly shaped
		by the expressive power of "multitape automata". We also
		briefly mention other models such as transducers to emphasize their
		relationship with our hierarchy.
		"Automatic relations" naturally emerge as one of the most expressive class of
		relations having desirable closure properties and
		for which most ``basic'' problems are decidable.

		After a brief logical interlude mostly dedicated to logical characterizations of 
		"automatic relations", we move on to "automatic structures", which
		are infinite "relational structures" that can be finitely described using
		"automatic relations". As a result, the first-order theory of such structures
		is decidable, explaining why "automatic structures" play a central role
		when looking for algorithms dealing with "infinite structures".
		Unfortunately, other decision problems, such as the "isomorphism problem",
		are undecidable, but become decidable when restricted to a specific
		subclass of structures. We hence conclude this chapter by
		discussing the computability status of natural decision problems
		on "automatic structures".
