\chapter{Introduction}

\begin{chapterpresentation}
	\begin{abstract}
		This chapter serves not only as an introduction, but as an extended
		abstract of the thesis. Its goal is to give to the reader an overview
		of the field and of the contributions made in this thesis.
		
		It is targeted at researchers in theoretical computer science.
		Hence, we assume the reader to be familiar with the basic concept occurring in
		this introduction, and will not give formal definitions: those
		will be given later, mostly in \todo{addref:3-chapter-prelims}.
		In case of any doubt, all pertinent notions are clickable: doing so
		will send you to their definition.
