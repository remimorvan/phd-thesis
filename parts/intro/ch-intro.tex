\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:intro}

	\begin{abstract}
		This chapter serves both as an introduction and as an extended abstract of the thesis. It provides an accessible overview of the broader research area, the specific questions addressed, and the contributions made in this work.
		Homomorphism problems lie at the heart of many foundational questions in logic,
		database theory and programming. After exposing the foundational results of
		these domains in the framework of homomorphisms,
		this chapter then summarizes the key contributions of this thesis.

		While this chapter is intended for readers with a background in theoretical computer science, it avoids formal definitions in favour of intuition and high-level explanations. Formal definitions can be found in \Cref{ch:general-preliminaries,ch:prelim-graph-databases,ch:preliminaries-automatic-structures}.
		When needed, terms and symbols can be clicked to navigate directly to their definitions elsewhere in the document.
