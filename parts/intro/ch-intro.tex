\chapter{Introduction}

\begin{chapterpresentation}
	\begin{abstract}
		This chapter serves as both an introduction and an extended abstract of the thesis. It provides an accessible overview of the broader research area, the specific questions addressed, and the contributions made in this work.
		Homomorphism problems lie at the heart of many foundational questions in logic,
		database theory and programming. This chapter introduces this framework,
		before summarizing the key contributions of the thesis.

		While this chapter is intended for readers with a background in theoretical computer science, it avoids formal definitions in favour of intuition and high-level explanations. Formal details can be found in \Cref{ch:general-preliminaries,ch:prelim-graph-databases,ch:preliminaries-automatic-structures}.
		When needed, terms and symbols can be clicked to navigate directly to their definitions elsewhere in the document.
