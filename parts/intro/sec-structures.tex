\section{The Two Sides of the Homomorphism Problem}

This thesis is devoted to studying variations of the "homomorphism problem",
a central concept in theoretical computer science.
Homomorphisms capture the idea of maps preserving relational information between mathematical structures.
They arise naturally across a variety of domains: in logic, as the mechanism behind positive-existential quantification; in database theory, as the semantics of conjunctive query evaluation; and in constraint satisfaction, as the formalization of whether a structure
satisfies a given set of rules. This thesis approaches the "homomorphism problem" as a unifying framework, by emphasizing its complementary role in data querying and constraint solving.

To introduce this problem, we present a wide range of examples---from
query evaluation to SAT solving---that call all be encoded as
"homomorphism problems".
Interestingly, they reveal a dichotomy on how problems are encoded as "homomorphism problems":
in some, the query appears on the left-hand side of the "homomorphism", 
while on others it appears on the right.
The first type of encoding correspond to what we call \emph{existential problems},
and are rooted in the field of \emph{database theory}:
we introduce this domain in \Cref{sec:intro-existential}.
On the other hand, the dual encoding deals with \emph{universal problems}
studied by the domain of \emph{constraint satisfaction}.
It is the focus of \Cref{sec:intro-universal}.
This dual perspective on the "homomorphism problem" guides the structure of
this thesis, which is separated into two independent parts.

\paragraph*{Homomorphisms.}
The simplest mathematical structure is perhaps that of a (directed) finite graph:
it consists of a finite set of vertices (also called \emph{domain}),
together with a set of "edges" $\+E \subseteq V \times V$.
A "homomorphism" between two graphs is then a
function $f$ between vertices that preserves
the "edges", in the sense that if $\tup{u,v}$ is an edge, then
$\tup{f(u),f(v)}$ must also be an edge. We depict
an example of graph "homomorphism" in \Cref{fig:example-graph-homomorphism}.

\end{figure}
To enrich the structure---but also, perhaps more enjoyably,
to add a splash of colour to this thesis---we will consider more complex structures: 
we allow for multiple edge relations, or even relations of higher arity linking the vertices.
The types and arities of relations allowed in a structure are specified by its "signature" $\sigma$.
These richer structures are known as "$\sigma$-structures" or "relational structures"---see
\Cref{fig:example-structure-homomorphism}---, and
"homomorphisms" between "$\sigma$-structures" are asked to preserve \emph{all} relations
in the "signature" $\sigma$.

\decisionproblem{The ""Homomorphism Problem"" over $\sigma$}{
	Two finite $\sigma$-structures $\?A$ and $\?B$.
}{
	Is there a "homomorphism" from $\?A$ to $\?B$?
}

In the problem above, we refer to $\?A$ as the \AP""input structure""
and to $\?B$ as the ""target structure"". We denote by \AP$\?A \intro*\homto \?B$
the existence of a "homomorphism" from $\?A$ to $\?B$.

More than a mere decision problem---which is easily seen to lie in "NP"---,
the "homomorphism problem" should rather be understood as a \emph{framework} or
\emph{language} to formalize many problems arising in computer science.

\begin{example}[Non-deterministic automata]
	\AP\label{ex:auto-as-rel}
	A (non-deterministic) automaton $\?A$ can be seen as a "relational structure",
	whose nodes are its states, on the "signature" with two unary predicates (one for
	describing initial states, one for final states), and one binary predicate
	for each letter of the alphabet $\Sigma$.
	Any finite word $u\in \Sigma^*$ can in turn be seen as a "relational structure"
	$\?W_u$ with $\lBrack 0,|u|\rBrack$ as its domain,
	where $0$ is initial, $|u|$ is final, and
	for each $i \in \lBrack 1,|u|\rBrack$, there is an edge from $i-1$ to $i$
	whose type is given by the $i$-th letter of $u$.
	Then, there is a "homomorphism" from $\?W_u$ to $\?A$ if, and only if, 
	the automaton $\?A$ accepts $u$. See \Cref{fig:example-automaton-as-rel}.
\end{example}

As we will see in the rest of this section,
depending on the context, either the query or the data may play the role of the input structure in the homomorphism problem. This distinction is fundamental and forms the basis for the two-part division of this thesis.

\end{marginfigure}
\begin{example}[Graph colouring]
	\AP\label{ex:graph-colouring-as-hom}
	Let $k\in\Np$. We let the \AP""$k$-clique"", denoted by $\intro*\clique{k}$,
	to be the "graph@@dir" whose vertices are $\lBrack 1,k\rBrack$,
	and with an edge from $i$ to $j$ (with $i,j \in \lBrack 1,k\rBrack$)
	"iff" $i\neq j$, see \Cref{fig:intro-3-clique}.
	Recall that a finite "graph@@dir" $\?G$ is \AP""$k$-colourable""---"ie"
	we can map every vertex of $\?G$ to an element of $\lBrack 1,k\rBrack$
	"st" no two adjacent vertices are sent on the same colour/number.
	In other words, a $k$-colouring corresponds precisely to a "homomorphism" from $\?G$
	to $\clique{k}$, where colours correspond to the vertices of the clique,
	see "eg" \Cref{fig:dichotomy-ex-3-clique}.
	Hence, a graph is "$k$-colourable" if, and only if,
	there is a "homomorphism" from $\?G$ to $\clique{k}$.
\end{example}

Note that in both \Cref{ex:auto-as-rel,ex:graph-colouring-as-hom},
not only is the existence of a homomorphism equivalent to the existence of a solution, but the set of homomorphisms naturally corresponds to the set of solutions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item in \Cref{ex:auto-as-rel}, "homomorphisms" from $\?W_u$ to $\?A$
		exactly correspond to accepting runs of the automaton over $u$;
	\item in \Cref{ex:graph-colouring-as-hom}, "homomorphisms" from $\?G$ to $\clique{k}$
		exactly correspond to $k$-colourings of $\?G$.

\begin{example}[SQL queries]
	\AP\label{ex:sql-as-hom}
	A "relational database", such as the one depicted on
	\Cref{fig:example-db-as-rel}, can easily be seen as a "relational structure"
	whose domain is the set of elements occurring somewhere in a table,
	with one relation for each table.
	The main difference between "relational databases" and "relational structures"
	precisely lies in the fact that in the case of the former, the domain is implicit,
	while for the latter it is explicit.%
	\footnote{While this difference alters the theory, the difference is mostly negligible
	for the "query@@sem" languages we will study, see \Cref{ch:prelim-graph-databases}.}

	Consider the following SQL query, which outputs all pairs
	of movie titles together with their projection time.
	\lstinputlisting[language=SQL, deletekeywords={TIME,Time,time}]{fig/intro/cinema.sql}

	This query $\gamma$ can in fact be seen itself as a "relational structure" $\?Q_\gamma$	over
	the same "signature" as the "relational database".
	Its domain has six elements, corresponding to the attributes of
	the \textsc{Movies} and \textsc{Projections} table, merged on the attribute
	$\textsf{Projections.movie\_id} = \textsf{Movies.id}$.
	Both relations $\textsc{Movies}$ and $\textsc{Projections}$ consist of a single tuple,
	and the relation $\textsc{Rooms}$ is empty, see \Cref{fig:example-sql-as-rel}.

	Then, the set of pairs $\tup{\textsf{title}, \textsf{time}}$
	such that there is a "homomorphism" from $\?Q_\gamma$ to the relational database, seen as
	a "relational structure", is exactly the output set of the SQL query on the database.
\end{example}

We now turn to more involved encodings, namely Sudoku grids and SAT solving,
to illustrate the expressive flexibility of the homomorphism framework.

		A prefilled sudoku grid.
	}
\end{marginfigure}
\begin{example}[Sudoku grids]
	\AP\label{ex:sudoku-as-hom}
	We represent an empty sudoku grid as the "relational structure"
	whose domain is $\lBrack 1,9\rBrack \times \lBrack 1,9\rBrack$---corresponding to coordinates in the grid---with
	three kinds of binary "predicates": $\+R$, $\+C$ and $\+S$,
	that describe when two coordinates are on the same row, column or 3*3-square, respectively.
	For non-empty grids, we add nine unary "predicates" $P_k$ ($k \in \lBrack 1,9\rBrack$),
	and if coordinate $\tup{i,j}$ is prefilled with number $k$, then predicate $P_k$ must
	hold on the element $\tup{i,j}$.
	Given a prefilled grid $G$, we denote by $\?S_G$ the associated "relational structure".
	
	We then define the target structure $\?T$ to have $\lBrack 1,9\rBrack$ as its domain:
	with the binary relations $\+R$, $\+C$ and $\+S$ which all three consist of
	all tuples $\tup{\tup{i,j},\tup{i',j'}}$ "st" $\tup{i,j} \neq \tup{i',j'}$.
	Moreover, each unary relation $P_k$ ($k \in \lBrack 1,9\rBrack$) is defined
	to hold only on $\{i\}$.
	Then, a prefilled grid $G$ can be completed if, and only if,
	$\?S_G$ has a "homomorphism" to $\?T$.%
	\footnote{In fact, for this example we could use only one binary predicate instead of three.
	Note that this encoding is actually quite close
	to graph colouring (\Cref{ex:graph-colouring-as-hom}) with an extra trick
	to force some values. This trick---formally called "marked structure"---will
	actually prove crucial in \Cref{ch:dichotomy-theorem}.}
	In fact, "homomorphisms" $h\colon \?S_G \to \?T$ exactly correspond to
	complete Soduku grid that extend $G$, with $h(\tup{i,j})$ giving
	the number contained in cell $\tup{i,j}$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[SAT solving]
	\AP\label{ex:sat-as-hom}
	We consider a 3-SAT instance, namely a finite conjunction of
	disjunctions of three litterals, say
	\[
		\phi \defeq \bigwedge_{i=1}^n \ell_{i,1} \lor \ell_{i,2} \lor \ell_{i,3},
	\]
	where each $\ell_{i,j}$ is either a variable, or the negation of a variable.
	We assume "wlog" that in each clause, positive variables appear before negative ones%
	\footnote{Meaning "eg" that $x \lor \neg y \lor z$ is not allowed, contrary to
	$x \lor z \lor \neg y$.}
	We let $\?B$ be the structure whose domain has two elements $\{0,1\}$,
	equipped with four ternary relations $+R_0$ through $+R_3$, where $+R_j$ encodes clauses with exactly $j$ negated literals. They are formally defined as
	\begin{align*}
		\+R_0 & \defeq \set{0,1}^3 \smallsetminus \set{\tup{0,0,0}}, &
		\+R_1 & \defeq \set{0,1}^3 \smallsetminus \set{\tup{1,0,0}}, \\
		\+R_2 & \defeq \set{0,1}^3 \smallsetminus \set{\tup{1,1,0}}, \text{ and} &
		\+R_3 & \defeq \set{0,1}^3 \smallsetminus \set{\tup{1,1,1}}.
	\end{align*}
	We then encode $\phi$ into the "relational structure" $\?F_\phi$
	whose domain is the set of variables of $\phi$,
	and for every $i \in \lBrack 1,n \rBrack$,
	$\+R_j$ ($j\in\lBrack 0,3\rBrack$) consists of all triplets of variables $\tup{x,y,z}$
	"st" there is a clause of $\phi$ containing variables $x$, $y$ and $z$ (with multiplicity), and exactly $j$ of these variables occur negatively.
	For instance, $\tup{x, y, \neg x} \in \+R_1$, and $\tup{\neg x, \neg y, \neg z} \in \+R_3$.
	A function $f$ from the domain of $\?F_\phi$ to the domain of $\?B$ amounts to picking
	a Boolean valuation of the variables occurring in $\phi$.
	Observe that, by definition of the relations $\+R_j$,
	given a clause $\psi$ containing variables $x,y,z$, 
	$f$ is a "homomorphism" from $\?F_\psi$ to $\?B$ "iff"
	$f$, seen as a valuation, satisfies $\psi$.\footnote{For instance,
	if all variables are positive, then all valuations except the one putting
	all variables to false satisfy the formula. This is why $\+R_0$ is defined
	on $\?B$ as $\set{0,1}^3\smallsetminus \set{\tup{0,0,0}}$.}
	By taking conjunction, the conclusion follows: "homomorphisms" from
	$\?F_\phi$ to $\?B$ exactly correspond to valuations satisfying $\phi$.
	In particular, there is a "homomorphism" from $\?F_\phi$ to $\?B$ "iff"
	$\phi$ is satisfiable.%

	However, the "signature" depends on $k$.}

All five problems we presented can actually be seen as model-checking problem:
part of the input represents some \emph{data}---or \emph{model}---and part of it represents a
\emph{"query@@sem"}---or \emph{logical question/specification}.
However, as depicted in \Cref{tab:examples-encodings-in-hom}, 
the encodings of these problems into "homomorphism problems" can either be of two types:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the \emph{"query@@sem"} is encoded in the "input structure",
		and the \emph{data} in the "target structure": we denote
		this family of problems by `$\textsf{query} \homto^? \textsf{data}$';
	\item in the other cases, the \emph{data} is encoded in the "input structure"
		and the \emph{"query@@sem"} is the "target structure": we denote
		these problems by `$\textsf{data} \homto^? \textsf{query}$'.
\end{itemize}

The two situations are far from symmetric: in model-checking, the size of the
data is usually much larger than query,%
\footnote{For instance, when analysing the documents in the \emph{Panama Papers} scandal,
the data represented 2.9 terabytes, while the queries were a few lines long. \cite{Neo4jPanama}}
and we often study problems where
the query is fixed---for instance the "$3$-colourability" problem.
Accordingly, this fundamental asymmetry between data and query roles not only motivates the structure of this thesis in two independent parts, but also underlies distinct research domains, known as \emph{database theory} and \emph{constraint satisfaction problems}.
% Formally, we define:
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\itemAP the ""combined complexity"" of a model-checking problem to be the complexity of
% 		the problem when both the "query@@sem" and the model are part of the input of the decision 
% 		problem;
% 	\itemAP the ""data complexity"" is the complexity of the same problem when the
% 		"query@@sem" is fixed: as there are multiple such problems---one for each "query@@sem"---, we
% 		say that the "data complexity" is $\+C$-complete, for some complexity class $\+C$, when
% 		every such problem is in $\+C$, and when at least one problem is $\+C$-hard.%
% 		\footnote{Of course the dual notion of ``query complexity'', also called ``expression complexity'' exists.}
% \end{itemize}
% For instance, first-order logic has a "combined complexity" that is "PSPACE"-complete
% \cite[Theorem~3.1.6]{Gradel2007FiniteModelTheory},
% but its "data complexity" is "uniform-AC0"!\footnote{I failed to found a proper reference claiming
% this "uniform-AC0" bound: \cite[Corollary~3.1.8]{Gradel2007FiniteModelTheory} only claims "ALogTime", however the "uniform-AC0" is trivial to show, as the formula precisely gives the shape
% of the circuits that needs to be built.} What this means is that the complexity
% of the model-checking problems depends more on the size of the formula than the input structure.

% Similarly, the "homomorphism problem" is not symmetric.
% If the "target structure" is fixed, the problem remains "NP"-complete---for instance
% 3-colourability and 3-SAT (\Cref{ex:graph-colouring-as-hom,ex:sat-as-hom}) are both
% examples of "NP"-complete problems where the "target structure" is fixed.
% However, if the "input structure" is fixed, the number of possible "homomorphisms"
% from $\?A$ to $\?B$ is at most $|B|^{|A|}$ and hence polynomial. In fact, the naive algorithm
% enumerating all possible functions and checking whether they are "homomorphisms" works
% is "LogSpace", and even better we can build from $\?A$ a small circuit
% solving the problem, giving a "uniform-AC0" upper bound.

% Both these asymmetries imply that, when encoding
% a model-checking problem as a "homomorphism problem", whether this encoding
% of the form $\textsf{query} \homto^? \textsf{data}$ or
% $\textsf{data} \homto^? \textsf{query}$ has a non-trivial impact on
% the complexity, and more generally on the properties, of the problem.
