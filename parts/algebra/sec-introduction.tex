As mentioned in \Cref{sec:preliminaries-automatic-structures-relations},
"automatic relation" can be seen as a regular language over the alphabet
$\SigmaPair \defeq (\Sigma \times \Sigma) \,\cup\,
(\Sigma \times \{\pad\}) \,\cup\, (\{\pad\} \times \Sigma)$ of pairs. On the other hand any regular language $L$ over $\SigmaPair$
produces an "automatic relation" when intersected with the language of all
"well-formed words"---namely words where the padding symbols are consistently placed;
see \Cref{sec:preliminaries} for precise definitions. In fact, the semantics
of "synchronous automata" such as the one in \Cref{fig:ex-sync-auto} is precisely defined this way:
it is the intersection of the ``classical semantic'' of the automaton, seen as an NFA, intersected
with "well-formed words".

\begin{figure}[htbp]

		\includegraphics[width=.4\linewidth]{fig/algebra/projection.png}

	\caption{
		\AP\label{fig:projection}
		Drawing in $(\SigmaPair)^*$ of a "$\+V$-relation" $\+R$ and $\negrel\+R \defeq \{(u,v) \in \Sigma^*\times \Sigma^* \mid (u,v) \not\in \+R\}$, where $\+R$ is defined as $L \cap \WellFormed$ with $L \in \+V$.
	} 
\end{figure}

In particular, a class $\+V$ of regular languages over
$\SigmaPair$
("eg" first-order definable languages, group languages, etc.) induces a class of so-called
"$\+V$-relations", defined as the relations over $\Sigma$ obtained as the intersection of some 
language of $\+V$ with "well-formed words", see \Cref{fig:projection}.
For instance, the relation of \Cref{fig:ex-sync-auto}
is a "$\+V$-relation" where $\+V$ is the class of all group languages---these relations can be 
alternatively described as those recognized by a deterministic complete synchronous automaton whose 
transitions functions are permutations of states.

\begin{question}
	\AP\label{quest:V-relations}
	Given a class $\+V$ of languages, can we characterize and decide the class of "$\+V$-relations"?
\end{question}

As we will see in \Cref{ex:group-languages}, being in $\+V_{\SigmaPair}$, as a language,
is a sufficient but not necessary condition for a relation to be a "$\+V$-relation".

\subsection{Contributions}

We answer positively to this question.
For this we first need to develop an algebraic theory of "automatic relations",
which enables us to prove the lifting theorem. In short, the "lifting theorem" states that algebraic characterizations of classes of word languages can be lifted in a canonical way to algebraic characterizations of classes of word relations.

The algebraic approach usually provides more than decidability: it attaches
canonical algebras to languages/relations ("eg" monoids for languages of finite words), and often simple ways to characterize complex properties ("eg" first-order definability, see "eg" \cite[Theorem 2.6, p.~40]{Bojanczyk2020MSO}).
Our "synchronous algebras" differ from monoids in two points:
\begin{itemize}
	\item they are typed---a quite common feature in algebraic language theory, shared "eg" by $\omega$-semigroups \cite[\S 4.1, p.~91]{Perrin2004InfiniteWords};
	% or Bojańczyk \& Walukiewicz's forest algebras \cite[\S 1.3, p.~4]{Bojanczyk2008Forest}; and
	\item they are equipped with a "dependency relation", which expresses constraints between 
	elements of different types---to our knowledge, this feature is entirely novel.\footnote{Note that algebras equipped with binary relations have been studied before, "eg" Pin's ordered 
	$\omega$-semigroups---see \cite[\S 2.4, p.~7]{Pin1998PositiveVarieties}---but the constraints (here the 
	orderings) are always defined between elements of the \emph{same type}.}
\end{itemize}
To understand how this "dependency relation" appears, we find that
looking at the "syntactic congruence@@sync" helps:
recall that the syntactic congruence of a language $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$
is defined by
\[
	u \sim_{L} v \quad\text{"iff"}\quad
	\forall x,y\in \Sigma^*,\; xuy \in L \Leftrightarrow xvy \in L.
\]
This relation is, by definition, an "equivalence relation".
We claim that the same definition cannot capture the essence of
"automatic relations", for the simple reason that it might be that
$u$, $v$, $x$ and $y$ are all "well-formed", and that
$xuy$ is "well-formed" but $xvy$ is not. In this case, 
asking for the property $xuy \in \+R \Leftrightarrow xvy \in \+R$ 
to hold does not make sense since the object $xvy$ simply does not exist
in our universe. To tackle this problem, we need to relativize this
property with the assumption that both $xuy$ and $xvy$ are "well-formed".
Doing so yields a notion of "syntactic congruence" that
makes sense---see \Cref{sec:syntactic-morphism} for the formal definition---,
however because of this relativization, it is no longer an "equivalence relation":
the non-trivial structure of this relation is precisely captured by the notion
of "dependency relation"!

\textbf{Importantly, some variations are possible on the definition of "synchronous algebras":
in particular, one could get rid of the notion of "dependency relation".
However, we show in \Cref{sec:counterexample} that these
simplified synchronous algebras cannot characterize the property of being a "$\symbf{\+V}$-relation".
Therefore, the notion of "dependency" seems necessary to tackle \Cref{quest:V-relations}.}
Moreover, we show that these algebras arise from a monad, but to our knowledge none of the 
meta-theorems developing algebraic language theories over monads apply to it,
see \Cref{apdx:monads} for more details.

We show that assuming that $\+V$ is a "$*$-pseudovariety of regular languages"---in short, a class of regular languages with desirable closure properties---, then the algebraic characterization of $\+V$ can be easily lifted to characterize "$\+V$-relations".

\begin{restatable*}[\reintro{Lifting theorem: Elementary Formulation}]{theorem}{liftingtheoremmonoids}
	\AP\label{thm:lifting-theorem-monoids}
	Given a relation $\+R$ and a "$\ast$-pseudovariety of regular languages" $\+V$
	"corresponding@@EilenbergSg" to a "pseudovariety of monoids" $\B{V}$,
	the following are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\+R$ is a "$\+V$-relation",
		\item $\+R$ is "recognized@@sync" by a finite "synchronous algebra" $\mathbf{A}$
			whose "underlying monoids" are all in $\symbb{V}$,
		\item all "underlying monoids" of the "syntactic synchronous algebras" $\SyntSA{\+R}$ of
			$\+R$ are in $\symbb{V}$.
	\end{enumerate} 
\end{restatable*}

This theorem rests on a solid algebraic theory. 
First, we show the existence of "syntactic algebras@@sync" (\Cref{lem:syntactic-morphism-theorem}): 
each relation $\+R$ admits a unique canonical and minimal algebra $\SyntSA{\+R}$, which is finite 
"iff" the relation is "automatic@@rel",
and then, we exhibit a correspondence between classes of finite algebras and classes of
automatic relations (\Cref{lem:eilenberg-sy})---we assume suitable closure properties; these classes are called ``pseudovarieties''.
While the proof structures of \Cref{lem:syntactic-morphism-theorem,lem:eilenberg-sy} follow the classic proofs, see "eg" \cite{Pin2022MathematicalFoundations},
the "dependency relation" has to be taken into account quite carefully, leading for instance
to a surprising definition of "residuals", see \Cref{def:residuals}.

\begin{remark}
	All our results are described for binary relations, but can be extended to
	$k$-ary automatic relations.
\end{remark}

\paragraph*{Organization.} After giving preliminary results in \Cref{sec:preliminaries}, we introduce
the "synchronous algebras" in \Cref{sec:synchronous-algebras} and show the existence of
"syntactic algebras@@sync". We then proceed to prove the "lifting theorem@@monoids" for 
"$*$-pseudovarieties@@reglang" in \Cref{sec:lifting-theorem}, and after introducing "$*$-pseudovarieties of automatic relations", we provide a more algebraic reformulation of the "lifting 
theorem@@monoidspseudovar" (\Cref{thm:lifting-theorem-monoids-pseudovarieties}).
We conclude the paper with
a short discussion in \Cref{sec:algebra-discussion}.

\end{itemize}

A systemic approach has been recently developed using monads, see \Cref{apdx:monads}.
For relations over words, "recognizable 
relations" are exactly the ones recognized by monoid morphisms $\Sigma^* \times \Sigma^* \to M$ 
where $M$ is finite. This can be trivially generalized to show 
that a relation $\+R$ is a finite union of Cartesian products of languages in $\+V$ if, and only 
if, it is recognized by a monoid from $\B{V}$, the pseudovariety of monoids corresponding to
$\+V$, see \Cref{prop:Mezei-theorem-generalization}.
In 2023, Bojańczyk \& Nguy\smash{\~{\^e}}n 
managed to develop an algebraic structure called ``transducer semigroups'' for ``regular functions'' \cite[Theorem 3.2, p.~6]{Bojanczyk2023Algebraic}, an 
orthogonal class of relations to ours---see \Cref{fig:landscape-rationality}.

The counterpart of "$\+V$-relations" for "deterministic transductions"
---that we call here \emph{deterministic $\+V$-transductions}---was studied by Filiot, Gauwin \& Lhote \cite{Filiot2019Logical}: they show that if
$\+V$ has decidable membership, then ``\emph{deterministic $\+V$-transductions}''
also have decidable membership \cite[Theorem 2.1]{Filiot2019Logical}---which is
proven via the use of a minimal object (a "deterministic transducer").
They extend their result to "functional transductions"
by showing the decidability of membership for \emph{functional $\+V$-transductions},
under the same assumption \cite[Theorem 4.10, p.~26]{Filiot2019Logical};
however this proof does not rely on a canonical construction but rather
on a finite set of minimal object.
These results are orthogonal to our "lifting theorem": 
"deterministic transductions" and "functional transductions"
are both orthogonal to the class of "automatic relations", see
\Cref{sec:preliminaries-automatic-structures-relations}.
% To achieve this, they associate
% to every rational relation a finite set of minimal bimachines \cite[Lemma 4.9, p.~26]{Filiot2019Logical},
% and show that a relation is a $\+V$-rational relation if, and only if, one of these bimachines
% belongs to $\+V$.\footnote{To be compared to our "automatic relations", which admit a unique minimal algebra.}
A different problem---focussing more on the semantics of the transduction---, called ``$\+V$-continuity'' was studied by Cadilhac, Carton \& Paperman \cite[Theorem 1.3, p.~3]{Cadilhac2020Continuity}, although it has to be noted that their results only concern
a finite number of pseudovarieties.
