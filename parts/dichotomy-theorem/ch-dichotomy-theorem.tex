\chapter{A Dichotomy Theorem for Automatic Structures}

Let \AP$\intro*\Fin$ denote the class of all "finite $\sigma$-structures",
\AP$\intro*\Aut$ the class of all "automatic $\sigma$-structures".
We let \AP$\intro*\AutPres$ be the class of all "automatic presentations of $\sigma$-structures",
and \AP$\intro*\FinPres$ be the subclass of "presentations" of "finite $\sigma$-structures".

We denote by \AP$\intro*\HomFinClass{\?B}$ and $\intro*\HomAllClass{\?B}$ the class
of all finite (resp. all) "$\sigma$-structures" that admit a "homomorphism" to $\?B$.

Given a "$\sigma$-structure" $\?B$, and a class $\classStruct$ of "automatic presentations of $\sigma$-structures", we denote by \AP$\intro*\HomDec{\classStruct}{\?B}$ the class of all presentations $\â€¢A \in \classStruct$ such that the "$\sigma$-structure" $\?A$
that they "represent@@structure" admits a "homomorphism" to $\?B$.
Similarly, we denote by \AP$\intro*\HomRegDec{\classStruct}{\?B}$ the class 
associated to "regular homomorphisms".%
\sidenote{Todo: set-theoretic bullshit. Not a set but it is if we fix an alphabet. Blabla.}

While the existence of a "homomorphism" from some "automatic presentation" of $\?A$ 
to a "finite $\sigma$-structure" $\?B$ only depends on $\?A$ and not the "presentation" itself,
this is not true for "regular homomorphism".
For a $\sigma$-structure $\?B$,
we use \AP$\intro*\HomFinDec{\?B}$, $\intro*\HomAutDec{\?B}$, $\intro*\HomRegFinDec{\?B}$
and $\intro*\HomRegAutDec{\?B}$ as shorthands for $\HomDec{\FinPres}{\?B}$, $\HomDec{\AutPres}{\?B}$,
$\HomRegDec{\FinPres}{\?B}$ and $\HomRegDec{\AutPres}{\?B}$, respectively.

Note that any "homomorphism" from an "automatic presentation" of a "finite structure"
to a "finite structure" is also "regular@@hom" and so $\HomFinDec{\?B} = \HomRegFinDec{\?B}$.\sidenote{Note also that membership in $\HomFinDec{-} = \HomRegFinDec{-}$ and in
$\HomAutDec{-}$ only depends on the "structure represented"
by the "automatic presentation", and not on the "presentation" itself.
This is not the case for $\HomRegAutDec{-}$. We use these definitions for two reasons: (1) for consistency with $\HomRegAutDec{-}$ and (2) for the associated decision problem to be defined unambiguously. Note moreover that in the case of "finite structures", the size of its representation, say using a adjacency lists, and of its "automatic presentation" are equal up to a TODO}
