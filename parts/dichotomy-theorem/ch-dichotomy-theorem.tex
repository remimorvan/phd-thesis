\chapter{A Dichotomy Theorem for Automatic Structures}
\label{ch:dichotomy-theorem}

\begin{chapterpresentation}
\begin{abstract}
	We study the separation problem of "automatic relations", "aka" "synchronous relations",
	by "recognizable relations"---namely finite unions of "Cartesian products" of "regular languages".
	We prove it to be computationally equivalent to the "finite regular colourability of automatic graphs", that takes an "automatic presentation" of a "graph@@dir" as input, and asks whether
	it admits a "regular colouring"---meaning that for each colour, the set of words representing the elements having this colour is a "regular language"---with finitely many colours.

	While the decidability of this problem remains open, we first show that,
	if the number of colours is fixed to be any natural number $k \geq 2$, then
	this problem is undecidable. This implies the undecidability of the separation problem
	of "automatic relations" by "recognizable relations" where the number of unions allowed is bounded.

	We then generalize this result, and prove a dichotomy theorem for automatic structures:
	for any "finite relational structure" $\?B$, the problem of whether an "automatic structure"
	admits a "homomorphism" to $\?B$ is either decidable in "NL", or is undecidable.
	We extend these results to "regular homomorphisms", for which we require the "homomorphisms"
	to be "regular@@hom", in the sense that every preimage of any element of the "target structure" $\?B$ must be a "regular language". In both cases, "structures" for which the problem is 
	decidable exactly correspond to those with ``"finite duality"''. 
	% 
	% Using this dichotomy theorem, we then prove that the original problem, 
	% namely the separation problem of "automatic relations"
	% by "recognizable relations" is undecidable.

	Part of the dichotomy theorem, corresponding to \Cref{sec:dichotomy-overview,sec:undecidability-hom,sec:hyperedge-consistency-finite,sec:hyperedge-consistency-automatic}, was proven by Antoine Cuvelier during an internship I supervised in summer 2024.
