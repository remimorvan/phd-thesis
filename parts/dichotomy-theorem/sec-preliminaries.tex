\subsection{Regular Homomorphisms}

Given two regular languages $K$ and $L$,\footnote{Note that whether $K$ and $L$ share the same alphabet is irrelevant since we can always work on the union of their alphabet.},
a \AP""regular function"" from
$K$ to $L$ is a function $f\colon K \to L$ "st" the relation
\[
	\{\tup{u, f(u)} \mid u \in K\}
\]
is "automatic@@rel".
A \AP""regular homomorphism"" between two "presentations of automatic $\sigma$-structures"
$\•A$ and $\•B$ is a "regular function" from $\domainPres{\•A}$ to $\domainPres{\•B}$
that defines a "homomorphism" from $\?A$ to $\?B$.\footnote{We use the terminology ``regular''
instead of ``automatic'' simply because ``automatic homomorphism'' sounds somewhat weird.}\footnote{Note that "regular homomorphisms" are to "automatic structures" what ``definable homomorphisms''
are to ``definable structures'' in \cite{KlinLasotaOchremiakTorunczyk2016HomomorphismProblems}: they form a restriction on the notion of "homomorphisms" to make then finitely describable---although the "input structure" might be infinite---, using the same logical framework as the one used to describe the "input structure".}

\begin{property}
	\label{prop:regular-function-finite-domain}
	Let $f\colon K \to L$ be a function, where $L$ is finite.
	Then $f$ is a "regular function" "iff" for every $v \in L$,
	$f^{-1}[v]$ is a "regular language".
\end{property}

\begin{proof}
	For the left-to-right implication, if $f$ is a "regular function",
	then there exists a first-order formula $\phi(x,y)$ "st"
	for all $\tup{u,v} \in K\times L$, then
	\[
		\univStructSynchronous{\Sigma}, u, v \models \phi(x,y)
		\text{ "iff" }
		v = f(u).
	\]
	Then given $v\in L$,
	the formula\footnote{``$y = v$'' is not properly defined in the syntax of "first-order logic" but it is straightforward to come up with a formula expressing this property.}
	\[
		\exists y,\, \phi(x,y) \land y = v
	\]
	describes $\{ u\in K \mid f(u) = v \}$, which is hence "regular@@lang".

	Conversely, we consider "first-order formulas" $\phi_{v}$ describing each set
	$\{ u\in K \mid f(u) = v \}$, with $v\in L$. Then
	\[
		\phi(x) \defeq \bigwedge_{v\in L} 
			\phi_{b}(x) \land y = v
	\]
	is a "first-order formula"---since $L$ is finite---describing $f$.
\end{proof}

In particular, a \AP""$k$-regular colouring"" of a "presentation of an automatic graph"
$\•G$ is equivalently a "regular homomorphism" from $\•G$ to $\?K_k$,
or a "$k$-colouring" "st" for any colour, the set of words of $\domainPres{\•G}$
sharing this colour is a "regular language". 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\input{tikz/dichotomy/grid-2-reg-colouring}
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{
		\AP\label{fig:grid-2-reg-colouring}
		A "$2$-regular colouring" of an "automatic presentation" of the infinite quarter-grid.
	}
\end{figure}
In \Cref{fig:grid-2-reg-colouring}, we provide an example of a "$2$-regular colouring".
The let $\+G = \tup{V,\+E}$ be the "automatic presentation" of the infinite quarter-grid,
defined over the alphabet $\{x,y\}$ by $V \defeq x^*y^*$ and
\[
	\+E = \set{\tup{x^p y^q, x^{p+1}y^q} \mid p,q \in \N}
	\cup
	\set{\tup{x^p y^q, x^p y^{q+1}} \mid p,q \in \N}.
\]
Then the unique "$2$-colouring" of $\+G$ assigns one colour%
\footnote{In yellow in \Cref{fig:grid-2-reg-colouring}.} to the
vertices of the form $x^p y^q$ "st" $p-q$ is even.
This "colouring" is of course "regular@@colouring".

Given a fixed "signature" $\sigma$ and a $\sigma$-structure $\?B$,
we denote by:
\begin{itemize}
	\itemAP $\intro*\HomFinDec{\?B}$ (resp. $\intro*\HomAutDec{\?B}$) the problem of, given a "finite $\sigma$-structure" (resp. "presentation of an automatic $\sigma$-structure"),
	whether it has a "homomorphism" to $\?B$,
	\itemAP $\intro*\HomRegFinDec{\?B}$ (resp. $\intro*\HomRegAutDec{\?B}$), the problem of,
	given a "finite $\sigma$-structure" (resp. "presentation of an automatic $\sigma$-structure"),
	whether it has a "regular homomorphism" to $\?B$.
\end{itemize}

Note that any "homomorphism" from an "automatic presentation" of a "finite structure"
to a "finite structure" is also "regular@@hom" and so $\HomFinDec{\?B} = \HomRegFinDec{\?B}$.\sidenote{Note also that membership in $\HomFinDec{-} = \HomRegFinDec{-}$ and in
$\HomAutDec{-}$ only depends on the "structure represented"
by the "automatic presentation", and not on the "presentation" itself.
This is not the case for $\HomRegAutDec{-}$. We use these definitions for two reasons: (1) for consistency with $\HomRegAutDec{-}$ and (2) for the associated decision problem to be defined unambiguously. Note moreover that in the case of "finite structures", the size of its representation, say using adjacency lists, and of its "automatic presentation" are equal up to a TODO}

\subsection{Constructions on Structures}

Given two "structures" $\?A$ and $\?B$, we define the structure \AP$\intro*\powstruct{\?B}{\?A}$ as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item its domain are "homomorphisms" $\?A \to \?B$,
  \item for every "predicate" $\+R$ of arity $k$, for any homomorphism $f_1,\hdots,f_k$,
  we have $\langle f_1,\hdots,f_k\rangle \in \+R(\powstruct{\?B}{\?A})$ when for every
  $\langle a_1,\hdots,a_k\rangle \in \+R(\?A)$
  then $\langle f_1(a_1), \hdots, f_k(a_k) \rangle \in \+R(\?B)$.
\end{itemize}


\begin{proposition}[Folklore: Currying Homomorphisms]
	\AP\label{prop:currying-hom}
	Given "structures" $\?A$, $\?B$ and $\?C$, if $f\colon \?A\prodstruct \?B \to \?C$
	is a "homomorphism", then $F\colon \?A \to \powstruct{\?C}{\?B}$,
	defined by $a \mapsto (b \mapsto f(a,b))$, is a "homomorphism".
	In fact, this mapping $f \mapsto F$ is a bijection
	between "homomorphisms" $\?A\prodstruct \?B \to \?C$
	and "homomorphisms" $\?A \to \powstruct{\?C}{\?B}$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let $\+R$ be a predicate of arity $k$, and let
$\langle a_1,\hdots,a_k \rangle \in \+R(\?A)$.
We want to show that $\langle F(a_1),\hdots,F(a_k) \rangle \in \+R(\powstruct{\?C}{\?B})$:
for any $\langle b_1,\hdots,b_k \rangle \in \+R(\?B)$, we have
\[\langle F(a_1)(b_1), \hdots, F(a_k)(b_k)\rangle = \langle f(a_1,b_1),\hdots,f(a_k,b_k) \rangle \in \+R(\?C)\] since $f$ is a "homomorphism" from $\?A\prodstruct \?B$ to $\?C$.
Hence, $F$ is indeed a "homomorphism" from $\?A$ to $\powstruct{\?C}{\?B}$.

Dually, if $F$ is a "homomorphism" from $\?A$ to $\powstruct{\?C}{\?B}$,
we define $f\colon \?A\prodstruct \?B \to \?C$ by $\langle a,b \rangle \mapsto F(a)(b)$,
and claim that $f$ is a "homomorphism". Indeed, if $\+R$ be a predicate of arity $k$,
for any $\langle a_1, \hdots, a_k \rangle \in \+R(\?A)$
and $\langle b_1, \hdots, b_k \rangle \in \+R(\?B)$,
we have $\langle f(a_1,b_1), \hdots, f(a_k,b_k) \rangle
= \langle F(a_1)(b_1), \hdots, F(a_k)(b_k) \rangle$.
Since $\langle F(a_1), \hdots, F(a_k) \rangle \in \+R(\powstruct{\?C}{\?B})$
and $\langle b_1, \hdots,b_k \rangle \in \+R(\?B)$ 
it follows that $\langle F(a_1)(b_1), \hdots, F(a_k)(b_k) \rangle \in \+R(\?C)$.
Therefore, $f$ is a "homomorphism" from $\?A \prodstruct \?B$ to $\?C$.

It is then routine to check that the maps $f \mapsto F$ and $F \mapsto f$ defined
in the two previous paragraphs are mutually inverse bijections.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Constructions on Automatic Presentations}
\label{sec:construction-automatic-presentations}

Let $\•A$ and $\•B$ be "automatic presentations" of some "$\sigma$-structures"
$\?A$ and $\?B$, over alphabets $\Sigma$ and $\Gamma$, respectively.
We define \AP$\•A \intro*\prodpres \•B$ to be the "presentation@@auto"
over the alphabet $(\Sigma \times \Gamma) \dcup \Sigma \times \{\pad\} \dcup \{\pad\} \times 
\Gamma$  "st":
\begin{align*}
	\domainPres{\•A\prodpres \•B} & \defeq \{u\convol v \mid u \in \domainPres{\•A} \land v \in \domainPres{\•B}\}\\
	\relPres{\+R}{\•A\prodpres \•B} & \defeq
		\{\tup{u_1\convol v_1,\, \hdots,\, u_k\convol v_k} \mid
		\tup{u_1,\, \hdots,\, u_k} \in \relPres{\+R}{\•A} \land
		\tup{v_1,\, \hdots,\, v_k} \in \relPres{\+R}{\•B}
	\}
\end{align*}
for each "predicate" $\+R$ of arity $k$ in $\sigma$.
It is an "automatic presentation" of $\?A \prodstruct \?B$.
Indeed, given a "first-order formula" $\phi(x_1,\hdots,x_k)$
over $\signatureSynchronous{\Sigma}$, describing $\relPres{\+R}{\•A}$,
and a "first-order formula" $\psi(x_1,\hdots,x_k)$
over $\signatureSynchronous{\Sigma}$, describing $\relPres{\+R}{\•B}$,
we let $\phi^*$ (resp. $\psi^*$) be the "formula@@FO" obtained from $\phi$ (resp. $\psi$)
by substituting $\lastLetter{a}(x)$ for $\bigvee_{b \in \Gamma \dcup \{\pad\}} \lastLetter{\tup{a,b}}(x)$ (resp. $\bigvee_{b \in \Sigma \dcup \{\pad\}} \lastLetter{\tup{b,a}}(x)$).
Then $\phi^* \land \psi^*$ is a "first-order formula", over the product alphabet,
that describes $\relPres{\+R}{\•A\prodpres \•B}$. The same construction
works for $\domainPres{\•A\prodpres \•B}$.
This shows that if $\?A$ and $\?B$ are "automatic $\sigma$-structures",
then so is $\?A \times \?B$.\footnote{Note that the "block product", that is defined similarly to the Cartesian product except that we ask one tuple to be in the relation, and the other to be in the equality relation---"ie" $\tup{u_1,\, \hdots,\, u_k} \in \relPres{\+R}{\•A}$ and
$v_1 = \cdots = v_k$, or its symmetric version---is also "automatic@@struct", using the same construction.
For instance, the infinite quarter-grid of \Cref{fig:grid-2-reg-colouring}
can also be constructed as the "block product" of $\tup{\N,+1}$ with itself.}

\begin{proposition}
	\label{prop:homreg-prod-finite}
	Let $\?A$, $\?B$ and $\?C$ be "automatic $\sigma$-structures", such that
	$\?B$ and $\?C$ are finite.
	Let $\•A$ (resp. $\•B$ and $\•B'$, resp. $\•C$ and $\•C'$) be an "automatic presentation"
	of $\?A$ (resp. $\?B$, resp. $\?C$).
	Then $\•A \prodpres \•B \homregto \•C$ "iff" $\•A \prodpres \•B' \homregto \•C'$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	The proof follows from the following claim, which can be proven
	exactly in the same fashion as \Cref{prop:regular-function-finite-domain}.

	\begin{claim}
		\label{claim:homreg-prod-finite}
		Assuming again that $\?B$ and $\?C$ are finite,
		a function $f\colon\•A \prodpres \•B \to \•C$ is a "regular homomorphism"
		"iff" for every $b\in \domainPres{\•B}$, for every $c\in \domainPres{\•C}$,
		\(\{
			a\in \domainPres{\•A} \mid f(a,b) = c
		\}\)
		is a "regular language".
	\end{claim}
\end{proof}

In other words, the existence of a "regular homomorphism" does not depend on the
"automatic presentation" of the \emph{finite} "structures" that are involved, but only
on the "structure" they represent.
As a consequence of \Cref{prop:homreg-prod-finite}, we write
\(\•A \prodpres \?B \homregto \?C\) as a synonym for \(\•A \prodpres \•B \homregto \•C\).

\begin{corollary}[Currying]
	\label{coro:homreg-currying}
	Let $\?A$, $\?B$ and $\?C$ be "automatic $\sigma$-structures",
	and let $\•A$ be an "automatic presentation" of $\?A$.
	Then $\•A \prodpres \?B \homregto \?C$ "iff" $\•A \homregto \powstruct{\?C}{\?B}$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
	This also follows from \Cref{claim:homreg-prod-finite}.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Idempotent Core}

We fix a "purely relational signature" $\sigma$.
Given a "$\sigma$-structure" $\?B$,
we denote by \AP$\intro*\extendedSignature{\sigma}{\?B}$
the signature obtained from $\sigma$ by adding
a unary predicate \AP$\intro*\unarypred{b}$ for each $b\in B$.
The \AP""marked structure"" \AP$\intro*\marked{\?B}$ of $\?B$ is the
"$\extendedSignature{\sigma}{\?B}$-structure"
obtained from $\?B$ by "interpreting@@predicate" each predicate $\unarypred{b}$ as the
singleton $\{b\}$.

\begin{proposition}[Folklore]
	\!\sidenote{The non-easy part is to reduce $\HomFinDec{\marked{\?B}}$ to $\HomFinDec{\?B}$: only this reduction
	requires the assumption that $\?B$ is a core. This reduction is folklore, see "eg"
	\cite[Lemma 2.5]{LaroseTesson2009UniversalAlgebraCSP}.
	TODO: understand if the proof is indentical to us. We provide here a self-contained proof.}%
	\sidenote{The "marked structure" $\marked{\core{\?B}}$ of the "core" of $\?B$ is
	usually called the \AP""idempotent core""
	of $\?B$. From this proposition, we get that $\HomFinClass{\?B}$ and
	$\HomFinClass{\marked{\core{\?B}}}$ are "first-order equivalent".
	This reduction is a central tool
	in the algebraic approach to understand "constraint satisfaction
	problem" since the algebra associated to the "CSP" over an "idempotent core"
	only has idempotent operations, making it much easier to work with.}%
	%%%
	\AP\label{prop:idempotent-core-preserves-csp-complexity}
	If $\?B$ is a finite "core", then the problems $\HomAllClass{\marked{\?B}}$ and 
	$\HomAllClass{\?B}$ are "first-order equivalent".
	Moreover, this equivalence preserves "finiteness@@structure".%
	\footnote{And hence, by restricting this equivalence, we obtain that
	$\HomFinClass{\marked{\?B}}$ and $\HomFinClass{\?B}$ are "first-order equivalent".}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{prop:idempotent-core-preserves-csp-complexity}]
	\proofcase{Reduction from $\,\HomAllClass{\?B}$ to $\,\HomAllClass{\marked{\?B}}$.}\\
	We reduce a "$\sigma$-structure" $\?A$ to the
	"$\extendedSignature{\sigma}{\?B}$-structure" $\?A'$ obtained
	from $\?A$ by "interpreting@@predicate" each predicate $\unarypred{b}$ as the empty set.
	Clearly, a function from $A$ to $B$ is a "homomorphism" from $\?A$ to $\?B$
	"iff" it is a "homomorphism" from $\?A'$ to $\marked{\?B}$, proving the correctness
	of the reduction. It is, by definition, "first-order@@reduction".

	\proofcase{Reduction from $\,\HomAllClass{\marked{\?B}}$ to $\,\HomAllClass{\?B}$.}
	We first define the reduction $\Phi$ and show its correctness, we will show later that it
	is a "first-order reduction". We reduce a "$\extendedSignature{\sigma}{\?B}$-structure" $\?A$ to the "$\sigma$-structure"
	$\Phi(\?A)$ defined as follows:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item its underlying universe is the disjoint union $A \dcup B$,
		\item given a "predicate" $\+R$ of arity $k$, its "hyperedges" are:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item all $\+R$-"hyperedges" of $\?A$,
		\item all $\+R$-"hyperedges" of $\?B$, and
		\item all $\+R$-"hyperedges" $\tup{b_1,\hdots,b_{i-1}, a_i, b_{i+1},\hdots,b_k}$
			"st" there exists $b_i$ for which the $\+R$-"hyperedge"
			$\tup{b_1,\hdots,b_{i-1}, b_i, b_{i+1},\hdots,b_k}$
			is in $\+R(\?B)$, and $a_i$ belongs to the "interpretation@@predicate" of 
			$\unarypred{b_i}$ in $\?A$.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	Note that by construction, the "neighbourhood" of $a \in A$ in $\Phi(\?A)$ is
	the union of its "neighbourhood" in $\?A$, and the union of the "neighbourhoods" of
	$b$ in $\?B$ for all $b$ "st" $a \in \unarypred{b}(\?A)$.

	We show that $\?A \in \HomAllClass{\marked{\?B}}$ "iff" $\Phi(\?A) \in \HomAllClass{\?B}$.
	So, assume that there exists a "homomorphism" $f\colon \?A \to \marked{\?B}$.
	Then we let $f'\colon A \dcup B \to B$ be defined by $f'(a) = f(a)$ for all $a\in A$ and
	$f'(b) = b$ for all $b \in B$. We claim that $f'$ is a "homomorphism" from
	$\Phi(\?A)$ to $\?B$. Indeed, consider a "hyperedge" of $\Phi(\?A)$:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item if it is a "hyperedge" of $\?A$, its image by $f'$ is still a "hyperedge"
			of $\?B$ since $f$ is a "homomorphism" from $\?A$ to $\marked{\?B}$;
		\item if it is a "hyperedge" of $\?B$, then its image by $f'$ is itself, and is hence
			a "hyperedge" of $\?B$;
		\item otherwise, it must be of the form 
			\[\tup{b_1,\hdots,b_{i-1}, a_i, b_{i+1},\hdots,b_k}\]
			"st" there exists $b_i$ for which
			$\tup{b_1,\hdots,b_{i-1}, b_i, b_{i+1},\hdots,b_k} \in \+R(\?B)$
			and $a_i \in \unarypred{b_i}(\?A)$:
			in this case, its image by $f'$ is 
			\[f'(\tup{b_1,\hdots,b_{i-1}, a_i, b_{i+1},\hdots,b_k})
			= \tup{b_1,\hdots,b_{i-1}, b_i, b_{i+1},\hdots,b_k} \in \+R(\?B)\]
			since $f'(b) = b$ for all $b\in B$ and $f'(a_i) = f(a_i) = b_i$ since
			$a_i \in \unarypred{b_i}(\?A)$ and $f$ is a "homomorphism" from
			$\?A$ to $\marked{\?B}$.
	\end{itemize}
	And hence, $\Phi(\?A) \homto \?B$.

	Dually, let $g\colon \Phi(\?A) \to \?B$ be a "homomorphism".
	Its restriction to $\?B$, namely $\restr{g}{B}$ is a "homomorphism" from $\?B$
	to itself, and since $\?B$ is a "core", it must be an "automorphism" over $\?B$
	by \Cref{prop:automorphism-core}.
	We then define a map $g' \colon A \to B$ by sending
	$a$ to $(\restr{g}{B})^{-1}\circ g(a)$, and claim that it is a "homomorphism"
	from $\?A$ to $\marked{\?B}$. As a matter of fact, it clearly preserves $\+R$-"hyperedges"
	for any $\+R$ in $\sigma$, since $g$ and $(\restr{g}{B})^{-1}$ are "homomorphisms".
	We must then show that it preserves all unary "predicates" $\unarypred{b}$, with $b\in B$:
	let $a \in A$ "st" $\unarypred{b}$ holds, "ie" $a \in \unarypred{b}(\?A)$.
	Now, by construction of $\Phi(\?A)$, the "neighbourhood" of $g(a)$ in $\?B$
	and the "neighbourhood" of $g(b)$ in $\?B$ are equal.
	Since $\?B$ is a "core", it follows by \Cref{prop:neighbourhood-core} that $g(a) = g(b)$.
	By definition of $g'$, this rewrites as $g'(a) = b$, "ie" $g'(a) = \unarypred{b}(\marked{\?B})$.
	Therefore, we have built a "homomorphism" from $\?A$ to $\marked{\?B}$.

	Overall, this proves that $\Phi$ is correct. It is straightforward to notice that
	it is a "first-order reduction" and that it preserves "finiteness@@structure" since $\?B$
	is "finite@@structure".
\end{proof}

	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{\AP\label{fig:zigzag-graph}The "zigzag graph" $\zigzag{5}{2}$.}
\end{figure}
\begin{example}
	\AP\label{ex:zigzag-defn}
	Let $n\in\?N$.
	We define the \AP""zigzag graph"" $\intro*\zigzag{n}{2}$ of width $n$ and length 2
	to be "graph" whose vertices are $a_0, \hdots, a_n$, $b_0, \hdots, b_{n}$,
	$a'_0$ and $b'_n$, with edges from $a_i$ to $b_{i-1}$ and to $b_{i}$ (for $i \in \lBrack 0,n\rBrack$, whenever the nodes exist), and with an edge from $a'_0$ to $a_0$ and from $b_n$
	to $b'_n$. See \Cref{fig:zigzag-graph} for an illustration.
	
	Note that $\zigzag{n}{2}$ does not admit a "homomorphism" to the "$2$-path"---indeed, such a homomorphism should send $a'_0$, $a_0$ and $b_0$ onto $0$, $1$, and $2$, respectively, 
	and so all $a_i$'s (resp. $b_i$'s) must be sent onto $1$ (resp. $2$), but then $b'_n$ cannot be mapped anywhere.

	On the other hand, $\zigzag{n}{2}$ admits a "homomorphism" to the "$2$-transitive tournament", as witnessed by \Cref{fig:zigzag-graph-hom-T2}.
	In fact, this "homomorphism" is far from being unique:
	each vertex $a_1,\,a_2,\,\hdots,\,a_{n-1}$ can be sent on either $0$ or $1$
	(the red and yellow vertices), 
	and similarly, each vertex $b_1,\,b_2,\,\hdots,\,b_{n-1}$ can be sent on either $1$ or $2$
	(the yellow and blue vertices).\footnote{Note that it is straightforward
	to extend these results---namely $\zigzag{n}{2} \homto \transitiveTournament{2}$
	and $\zigzag{n}{2} \nothomto \pathGraph{2}$---to arbitrary values of $k\in \N$ with
	$k\geq 2$, namely $\zigzag{n}{k} \homto \transitiveTournament{k}$
	and $\zigzag{n}{k} \nothomto \pathGraph{k}$, by letting
	$\zigzag{n}{k}$ be the graph obtained from $\zigzag{n}{2}$ by
	replacing the path leading to $a_0$ by a path of length $k-1$.
