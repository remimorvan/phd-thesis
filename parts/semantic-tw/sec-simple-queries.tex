\section{\AP{}Semantic Tree-Width for Simple Queries}
\label{sec:sre}
\AP A ""simple regular expression"", or \reintro{SRE}, is a regular expression the form $a^*$ for some letter $a \in \A$ or of the form $a_1 + \dotsb + a_m$ for some $a_1, \dotsc, a_m \in \A$. 

\AP Let \intro*{\UCRPQSRE} be the set of all "UCRPQ" whose languages are expressed via "SREs". Observe that {\UCRPQSRE} is "semantically equivalent" to the class of "UCRPQs" over the closure under concatenation of "simple regular expressions"
since $\gamma(x,y) = x \atom{e_1 \cdot e_2} y$ is equivalent to $\gamma'(x,y) = x \atom{e_1} z \land  z \atom{e_2} y$.
Moreover, \UCRPQSRE{} also corresponds to "UC2RPQ" whose languages are expressed via "SREs";
in other words adding two-wayness does not increase the expressivity of the class. 
% for example, $\gamma(x,y) = x \atom{a^* \cdot (a + b) \cdot b^*} y$ is equivalent to $\gamma'(x,y) = x \atom{a^*} z \land z \atom{a+b} z' \land z' \atom{b^*} y$.
%
% The interest of {\UCRPQSRE} comes from the fact that it is used widely in practice, as recent studies on SPARQL query logs on Wikidata, DBpedia and other sources \cite{BonifatiMT-www19,BonifatiMT-vdlbj20} show that this kind of regular expressions cover a majority of the queries investigated, \eg, over 98\% of the 500 million expressions in the Wikidata log  (\cf~\cite[Table~1]{FigueiraGKMNT20}).

One interest of {\UCRPQSRE} comes from the fact that it is used widely in practice, as recent studies on SPARQL query logs on Wikidata, DBpedia and other sources show that this kind of regular expressions cover a majority of the queries investigated, "eg", 75\% of
the ``property paths'' ("C2RPQ" "atoms") of the corpus of 1.5M queries of Bonifati, Martens and Timm \cite[Table 15]{BonifatiMT-vdlbj20}.
An additional interest comes from the fact that the "containment problem" for {\UCRPQSRE} is much better behaved than for general "UCRPQs", since it is in {"PiP2"} \cite[Corollary 5.2]{FigueiraGKMNT20}, that is, just one level up the polynomial hierarchy compared to the "CQ" "containment problem", which is in "NP" \cite{DBLP:conf/stoc/ChandraM77}, and in sharp contrast with the costly "ExpSpace"-complete "CRPQ" "containment problem" \cite{CGLV00,Florescu:CRPQ}.

We devote this section to showing the following result.

% Main theorem : introduced in intro-prelim.tex
\thmSemTwSREpitwo 

% Observe that, for the particular case of an "SRE" $e$, $\+A_e[q,q']$ is also expressible via an "SRE". In fact, "SRE" is "effectively closed under sublanguages". 
Observe that "simple regular expressions" are "closed under sublanguages". Hence, in the light of
\Cref{thm:closure-under-sublanguages}, the "maximal under-approximation" of a {\UCRPQSRE} query by infinitary unions of "CQs" of "tree-width" $k$ is always equivalent to a {\UCRPQSRE} query  of "tree-width" $k$. We will see how the construction of the "maximal under-approximation" of the previous section can be exploited to improve the complexity from "2ExpSpace" down to "PiTwo".

\subsection{\AP{}Summary Queries}
We will first show that the "maximal under-approximation" of "tree-width" $k$ of a "UC2RPQ" can be expressed as a union of polynomial sized ``summary'' queries. Each "summary query" represents a union of exponentially-bounded "C2RPQs" sharing some \emph{common structure}. 
"Summary queries" are normal "UC2RPQ" queries extended with some special kind of atoms, called ``"path-$l$ approximations"''. 
Intuitively, they represent a "maximal under-approximation" of "tree-width" $l$ of queries of the form $\bigwedge_i x_i \atom{L_i} y_i$ such that $x_i \neq y_j$ for all $i,j$. 
Path-$l$ approximations may require an exponential size when represented as "UC2RPQs".
%
\AP Formally, a ""path-$l$ approximation"" is a query of the form ``$\intro*\pathl(X, Y, \delta)$''
where: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $X$, $Y$, are two disjoint sets of variables of size at most $l$, 
	\item $\delta(\bar z)$ is a conjunction of "atoms" $\bigwedge_{1 \leq i \leq n} A_i$ where $\bar z$ contains all variables of $X \cup Y$,
	\item each $A_i$ is a "C2RPQ" atom of the form $x \atom{L} y$ or $y \atom{L} x$  such that $x \in X$, $y \in Y$, and $L_i$ is a regular language over $\A$.
	%% OLD VERSION:
	% \item $\delta(\bar z)$ is a conjunction of "atoms" $\bigwedge_{1 \leq i \leq n} A_i(x_i,y_i)$ where $\bar z$ contains all variables of $X \cup Y$,
	% \item each $A_i$ is a "C2RPQ" atom of the form $x_i \atom{L} y_i$ or $y_i \atom{L} x_i$  such that $x_i$ is in $X$ and $y_i$ is in $Y$, and $L_i$ is a regular language over $\A$.
\end{enumerate}
We give the semantics of $\pathl(X, Y, \delta)$ in terms of infinitary unions of "C2RPQs".
A query like the one before is defined to be equivalent to the (infinitary) union of all queries $\alpha(\bar z) \in \MUA{\delta}{\Pw[l]}$ such that
\begin{align}
	\text{$\alpha$ has a "path decomposition" of "width" $l$ where $X$ is the root and $Y$ is the leaf,}\AP\label{eq:pathl:rootleafppty}
\end{align}
that is, the root and leaf "bags" contain precisely the vertices of $X$ and $Y$, respectively.
 See \Cref{fig:l-path-example} for an example.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{summary-example.pdf}
  \caption{
	\AP\label{fig:l-path-example}
	Consider the "path-$l$ approximation" $\pathl(\set{x_1,x_2}, \set{y_1,y_2},\delta)$ where $l=2$ and $\delta$ is depicted on the left. Its semantics contains the "approximation" $\alpha(x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2) \in \MUA{\delta}{\Pw[l]}$ depicted in the middle because it has "path decomposition" of "width" $l$ verifying \eqref{eq:pathl:rootleafppty}, as shown on the right.
	}
\end{figure}

\AP We now simply define a ""$k$-summary query"" as a "C2RPQ" extended with "path-$l$ approximation" atoms for any $l\leq k$, with the expected semantics.
A \AP""refinement@@summary"" of a "$k$-summary query" is any "C2RPQ" obtained by
replacing "atoms" with "atom refinements", and 
each "path-$l$ approximation" $\pathl(X, Y, \delta)$ with any
$\alpha(\bar z) \in \MUA{\delta}{\Pw}$ verifying \eqref{eq:pathl:rootleafppty}. By definition,
a "database" satisfies a "$k$-summary query" if and only if it
satisfies one of its "refinements@@summary".

A \AP ""tree decomposition@@summary"" of a "$k$-summary query" $\gamma$ consists of
a pair $(T, \bagmap)$ with $\bagmap: \vertex{T} \to \pset{\vars(\gamma)}$
such that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item for every classical "atom" $x \atom{L} y$ in $\gamma$,
		there is a "bag" $b \in T$ such that $\{x,y\} \subseteq \bagmap(b)$;
	\item for every "path-$l$ approximation" $\pathl(X, Y, \delta)$ in $\gamma$,
		there are two adjacent "bags" $b, b' \in T$ such that $X \subseteq \bagmap(b)$
		and $Y \subseteq \bagmap(b')$.
\end{itemize}
The "width" is defined as usual. Then, by
\Cref{fact:refinement-tw}, we obtain the following upper bound.

\begin{fact}
	\AP\label{fact:tree-width-summary}
	For any $k\geq 2$, any "refinement@@summary" of a "$k$-summary query" with
	a "tree decomposition@@summary" of "width" at most $k$ is a "C2RPQ" of "tree-width" at most $k$.
\end{fact}

Lastly, a \AP""homomorphism@@summary"" from a "C2RPQ"
$\gamma(\bar z) = \bigwedge_{i} x_i \atom{L_i} y_i$
to a "summary query" $\delta(\bar z') =
\bigl( \bigwedge_{j} x'_j \atom{L'_j} y'_j \bigr)
\wedge \bigl( \bigwedge_{j'} \pathl(X_{j'}, Y_{j'}, \delta_{j'}) \bigr)$
consists of a mapping $\fun$ from variables of $\gamma$ to variables of $\delta$
such that $f(\bar z) = \bar z'$, and for each $i$,
there is an atom $f(x_i) \atom{L_i} f(y_i)$ in $\delta$.
Note that if there is a homomorphism from $\gamma(\bar z)$ to $\delta(\bar z')$,
then $\delta(\bar z') \contained \gamma(\bar z)$.

Let us fix $\+L$ to be any class  "closed under sublanguages". For every $\gamma \in \CtwoRPQ(\+L)$, we define \AP $\intro*\Qapp$ as the set of all "$k$-summary queries" $\alpha$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
	\item $\alpha$ has a "fine tagged tree decomposition" $(T, \bagmap)$ of "width" at most $k$,
	\item there exists a "strong onto" "homomorphism@@summary" from a "refinement" $\rho$ of $\gamma$ to $\alpha$, 
	\item $T$ has at most $2\nbatoms{\gamma}$ leaves, and every
		"non-branching path" of $T$ consisting only of "non-atomic" "bags" must contain at most two "non-full bags".
\end{enumerate}
Note that since $\alpha$ is a homomorphic image a "refinement" of $\gamma$,
and since $\+L$ is "closed under sublanguages", then $\alpha$ has only $\+L$-labelled "atoms".

\begin{lemma}\AP\label{lemma:MUAk-union-of-polysized-summary-test-np}
    \AP Let $k \geq 2$. For every \textbf{finite} class $\+L$ "closed under sublanguages",
	and for every $\gamma \in \CtwoRPQ(\+L)$, 
	% define \AP $\intro*\Qapp$ as the set of all
	% "$k$-summary queries" $\alpha$ such that:
	% \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	% 	\item $\alpha$ has a "fine tagged tree decomposition" $(T, \bagmap)$ of "width" at most $k$,
	% 	\item there exists a "homomorphism@@summary" from a "refinement" $\rho$ of $\gamma$
	% 		to $\alpha$, and
	% 	\item $T$ has at most $2\nbatoms{\gamma}$ leaves, and every
	% 		"non-branching path"
	% 		of $T$ consisting only of "non-atomic" "bags" must contain at most two "non-full bags".
	% \end{enumerate}
	% Then, 
	we have:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\itemAP \label{lemma:MUAk-union-of-polysized-summary-test-np:1} $\Qapp \semequiv \MUA{\gamma}{\Tw}$,
		\itemAP \label{lemma:MUAk-union-of-polysized-summary-test-np:2} $\Qapp$ is a union of polynomial-sized "$k$-summary queries" having only
			$\+L$-labelled "atoms", and
		\itemAP \label{lemma:MUAk-union-of-polysized-summary-test-np:3} one can test in "NP" if a "summary query" is part of this union.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
% \begin{proof}[Informal proof]
%   As corollary of the proof of \Cref{lemma:bound_size_refinements}, we can assume to have 
%   $\MUA{\gamma}{\Tw}$ expressed as a union of $\CtwoRPQ(\+L)$ with a "nice tree decomposition" of "width" $k$ with a linear number of leaves, and hence it suffices to replace "non-branching paths" with "path-$l$ approximations".
%   Concretely, for any such "C2RPQ" $\alpha$ having a witnessing "tree decomposition" with a long "non-branching path", the tree must contain a sub-path whose every bag is "non-atomic", and such that it starts and ends in "bags" of size at most $k$ (by the "niceness" property).
%   Such a "non-atomic" "non-branching path" can be ``compressed'' by replacing the subquery corresponding to the path with a corresponding "path-$l$ approximation" query. The resulting summary query will "contain" $\alpha$ and in turn be "contained" in $\gamma$. Simultaneously applying such replacement to all "non-atomic" "non-branching paths" of maximal length then yields a polynomial sized "summary query".
  
%   Further, given a "$k$-summary query" $\sigma$, one can test in "NP" whether there exists an element of $\MUAHom{\gamma}{\Tw}$ that leads to such "summary query" by the process just mentioned. This is done by first checking that $\sigma$ is of the ``right shape'' (essentially a query of tree-width $k$ when disregarding the "path-$l$ approximation" atoms), and that it is "contained" in $\gamma$ via a polynomial "refinement" $\rho \in \Refin(\gamma)$ and a "strong onto homomorphism" to the query resulting from replacing $\pathl(X,Y,\delta)$ atoms with $\delta$ in $\sigma$.

% \end{proof}
\begin{proof}
	Point \eqref{lemma:MUAk-union-of-polysized-summary-test-np:2} follows directly from the definition: there are few branches in the decomposition, branches are short, and each "bag" cannot contain more than $(k+1)^2 \cdot |\+L|$ "atoms" labelled with $\+L$-languages.

	For point \eqref{lemma:MUAk-union-of-polysized-summary-test-np:3}, recall that one can check if a query has "tree-width" at most $k$ in linear time, "eg" using Bodlaender's algorithm \cite[Theorem 1.1]{bodlaender1996treewidth}.

	% Points \eqref{lemma:MUAk-union-of-polysized-summary-test-np:2} and \eqref{lemma:MUAk-union-of-polysized-summary-test-np:3} follow directly from the definition---recall
	% that one can check if a query has "tree-width" at most $k$ in linear time
	% with Bodlaender's algorithm \cite[Theorem 1.1]{bodlaender1996treewidth}.

	To prove \eqref{lemma:MUAk-union-of-polysized-summary-test-np:1}, notice first that 
	$\Qapp \contained \MUA{\gamma}{\Tw}$ as a consequence
	of \Cref{fact:tree-width-summary}.

	For the converse "containment", we use \Cref{coro:equivalence_under_approx_homomorphism_twk}
	and prove instead $\MUAHom{\gamma}{\Tw} \contained \Qapp$.
	Observe that, as corollary of the proof of \Cref{lemma:bound_size_refinements}, we can assume to have 
	$\MUAHom{\gamma}{\Tw}$ expressed as a union of $\CtwoRPQ(\+L)$ with a "fine tagged tree decomposition" of "width" $k$ with at most $2\nbatoms{\gamma}$ leaves, and hence it suffices to replace each "non-branching paths" having "non-atomic" bags with "path-$l$ approximations".

	Indeed, fix a "fine tagged tree decomposition" and a "trio"
	$\fun\colon \rho \surj \alpha$. Given a long "non-branching path" from "bag" $b_X$ with
	variables $X$ to a "bag" $b_Y$ with variables $Y$,
	such that $b_X$ and $b_Y$ are "non-full", and no "bag" in between is "atomic",
	define $X' \defeq X \setminus Y$ and $Y' \defeq Y \setminus X$.
	Consider the set $\+S$ of "atoms" $u \atom{L} v$ of $\gamma$, such that the "path induced"
	$\bigl( {b_i \choose z_i} \bigr)_i$ by the "refinement", say
	\[
		u = w_0 \atom{L_0} w_1 \atom{L_1} \cdots \atom{L_n} w_n	= v
	\]
	of $u \atom{L} v$ in $\rho$ 
	goes through $b_X$ at some variable of $X'$ and through $b_Y$ at some variable
	of $Y'$, in the sense that $b_i = b_X$ and $z_i \in X'$ for some $i$,
	and $b_j = b_Y$ and $z_j \in Y'$ for some $j$.
	There exist $i', j'$ such that $f(w_{i'}) = z_i$ and $f(w_{j'}) = z_j$,
	and "wlog" $i' < j'$.
	Now let $\alpha'$ be the query obtained from $\alpha$ by removing all "atoms" tagged in a bag between $b_X$ and $b_Y$, and add a "path-$l$ approximation" query
	\[
		\pathl(X', Y', \delta)
	\]
	where $\delta$ is the conjunction over $u \atom{L} v \in \+S$ of
	$w_{i'} \atom{\contract{L_{i'}\cdots L_{j'}}} w_{j'}$.
	Repeat this operation for every non-trivial "non-branching path" with
	"non-atomic" "bags". We obtain $\alpha'' \in \Qapp$ "st"
	$\alpha \contained \alpha''$, which concludes the proof
	that $\MUAHom{\gamma}{\Tw} \contained \Qapp$.
\end{proof}


\subsection{\AP{}Semantic Tree-Width Problem}
With the previous results in place, we now show that the semantic tree-width $k$ problem is in {"PiP2"} for \UCRPQSRE, for every $k>1$.

\thmSemTwSREpitwo*
%Theorem: For every $k>1$, the "semantic tree-width $k$ problem" for {\UCRPQSRE} is in "PiP2".
\begin{proof}
  It suffices to show the statement for any $\CRPQSRE~\gamma$. Remember that $\gamma$ is of "semantic tree-width" $k$ if, and only if, $\gamma \contained \Qapp$. The first ingredient to this proof is the fact that this "containment" has a polynomial counterexample property.
%   \begin{restatable}{clm}{claimpolysizedcounterexamplesre}
%     \AP\labelwithproof{claim:poly-sized-counterexample-sre}
%     If $\gamma \centernot{\contained} \Qapp$ then there is a polynomial-sized "expansion" $\anexpansion$ of $\gamma$ such that $\anexpansion \centernot{\contained} \Qapp$.
%   \end{restatable}
  
  \begin{claim}\AP\label{claim:poly-sized-counterexample-sre}
    If $\gamma \centernot{\contained} \MUAHom{\gamma}{\Tw} $ then there is a polynomial-sized "expansion" $\anexpansion$ of $\gamma$ such that $\anexpansion \centernot{\contained} \MUAHom{\gamma}{\Tw} $.
  \end{claim}
  \begin{proof}
    \newcommand{\Qalt}{\+U}
    \AP
    Let us call any atom with a language of the form $a^*$ a ""recursive atom"", and any other atom a ""non-recursive atom"".
    Let $n$ be the number of "non-recursive atoms" of $\gamma$. Hence, any refinement $\rho \in \Refin(\gamma)$ has $n$ atoms deriving from "non-recursive@@nrat" "atom refinements", all the remaining ones derive from "recursive@@rat" "atom refinements".

    We will work with the infinitary union of "conjunctive queries" $\Qalt\defeq\MUAHom{\gamma}{\Tw} \cap \textnormal{"CQ"}$. Note that $\Qalt=\set{ \alpha \in \textnormal{"CQ"} \mid \alpha \in \Tw \text{ and there is } \anexpansion \in \Exp(\gamma) \text{ "st" } \anexpansion \surj \alpha }$.
    It is easy to see that $\Qalt \semequiv \MUAHom{\gamma}{\Tw}$ as a consequence of \Cref{fact:refinement-tw}.
	% (and thus $\Qalt \semequiv \Qapp$).
    By \Cref{prop:cont-char-exp-st}, we have $\gamma \centernot{\contained} \Qalt$ if, and only if, there is some "expansion" $\anexpansion$ of $\gamma$ such that $\anexpansion \centernot{\contained} \Qalt$. In turn, this happens if, and only if, there is no $\delta \in \Qalt$ such that $\delta \homto \anexpansion$.
    
    Take any such counterexample $\anexpansion$ of minimal size (in number of atoms). We show that for any "internal path" of $\anexpansion$ of the shape
    \[\pi = x_0 \atom{a} x_1 \atom{a} x_1 \dotsb x_{m-1}\atom{a} x_m,\]
    we have $m \leq n+1$. Hence, since $\anexpansion$ is an "expansion" of a {\CRPQSRE}, this means that the size of each \AP""atom expansion""---namely an "expansion" obtained from a query by only expanding one "atom"---of $\anexpansion$ is linearly bounded in the size of $\gamma$, and thus that $\anexpansion$ is quadratically bounded.

    By means of contradiction, if $m > n+1$ consider the "expansion" $\anexpansion'$ resulting from ``shrinking'' the path $\pi$ to a path $\pi'$ of length $n+1$. Hence, $\anexpansion'$ is smaller than $\anexpansion$, and since $\anexpansion$ was assumed to be minimal, $\anexpansion'$ cannot be a counterexample. Thus, there is some $\delta \in \Qalt$ such that $\fun_1:\delta \homto \anexpansion'$ for some "homomorphism" $\fun_1$. Further, by definition of $\Qalt$, we have $\fun_2 : \anexpansion'' \surj \delta$ for some $\anexpansion'' \in \Exp(\gamma)$. Consider then the composition $\anexpansion'' \surj \delta \homto \anexpansion'$ of $\fun_2$ with $\fun_1$ and let us call it $g: \anexpansion'' \homto \anexpansion'$. By definition of $n$ there must be at least one atom $x_i \atom{a} x_{i+1}$ of the shrunken path $\pi'$ of $\anexpansion'$ which either 
		(i) is not in the image of $\fun_1$, or 
		(ii) all its $g$-preimages proceed from "atoms" $z \atom{a} z'$ of $\anexpansion''$ which are in the "expansions" of "recursive atoms" of $\gamma$. 
	We show that, in both cases, we can replace $x_i \atom{a} x_{i+1}$ with a path of $a$'s of any arbitrary length $l>0$, obtaining a "conjunctive query" $\anexpansion'_{+l}$  which
	is---still---not a counterexample.  In the first case (i), we actually obtain that $\delta \homto \anexpansion'_{+l}$. In the second case (ii), we have to replace each atom $z \atom{a} z'$ in the $g$-preimage of $x_i \atom{a} x_{i+1}$ in $\anexpansion''$ by an $a$-path of length $l$, obtaining some "expansion" $\anexpansion''_{+l}$ of $\gamma$. We also replace each atom in the $\fun_1$-preimage of $x_i \atom{a} x_{i+1}$ by an $a$-path of length $l$ obtaining some $\delta_{+l}$ such that $\anexpansion''_{+l} \surj \delta_{+l} \homto \anexpansion'_{+l}$. Further, $\delta_{+l} \in \Tw$ since $\Tw$ is closed under "refinements" by \Cref{fact:refinement-tw}.
    In both cases this shows that $\anexpansion'_{+l}$ is \emph{not} a counterexample. 
	In particular, for $l=m-n-1$, we have $\anexpansion'_{+l}=\anexpansion$, and this would contradict the fact that $\anexpansion$ is a counterexample.
	Therefore, there exists a counterexample of polynomial (quadratic) size whenever $\gamma \centernot{\contained} \MUAHom{\gamma}{\Tw}$.
  \end{proof}
%   This is because any path $x_0 \atom{a}  \dotsb \atom{a} x_m$ in an expansion $\anexpansion$ of $\gamma$ such that $m > \nbatoms{\gamma}$ and $\anexpansion \contained \Qapp$ can be `pumped' to an even longer path of any length greater than $m$ obtaining another expansion $\anexpansion'$ such that $\anexpansion' \contained \Qapp$. This implies that a minimal counterexample must be of polynomial size. \ifspaceallows{The proof uses rather standard techniques and can be found in \Cref{appendix:sre}.}{}
  The second ingredient is that testing whether a "CQ" is a counterexample is in "coNP".

  \begin{claim}\AP\label{claim:cq-in-Qapp-np}
    The problem of testing, given a "C2RPQ" $\gamma$ and a "CQ" $\xi$, whether $\xi \contained \Qapp$, is in "NP".
  \end{claim}
  % \begin{proof}[Informal proof]
  %   We first guess a polynomial-sized "$k$-summary query" $\delta_{\textup{zip}}$ and test in "NP" that it is part of $\Qapp$ by \Cref{lemma:MUAk-union-of-polysized-summary-test-np}. 
  %   We now guess a valuation $\mu :  \vars(\delta_{\textup{zip}}) \to \vars(\gamma)$ and test that it is a "homomorphism" $\anexpansion \homto \gamma$, where $\anexpansion$ is an expansion of the "CRPQ" resulting from discarding the "path-$l$ approximation" atoms of $\delta_{\textup{zip}}$, which can be done in \nl. It remains to check that each atom $\pathl(X,Y,\hat \delta)$ of $\delta$ has an "expansion" $\hat\anexpansion$ such that $h : \hat\anexpansion \homto \gamma$ for a "homomorphism" such that $h(x)=\mu(x)$ for all $x \in X \cup Y$. This can be done via an \nl algorithm using $l+1$ pointers to traverse the "width"-$l$ "fine" "path decomposition" of $\hat\anexpansion$, simultaneously guessing $\hat\anexpansion$, the "expansion" of $\gamma$ which homomorphically maps to $\hat\anexpansion$, and the valuation of $h$.
  % \end{proof}
  \begin{proof}
        We first guess a polynomial-sized "$k$-summary query" $\delta_{\textup{zip}}$ and test in "NP" that it is part of $\Qapp$ by \Cref{lemma:MUAk-union-of-polysized-summary-test-np}. 
        Let us call $\Delta$ be the equivalent {\UCRPQSRE} query, given by \Cref{lemma:MUAk-union-of-polysized-summary-test-np} \textit{cum} \Cref{lemma:bound_size_refinements}.
        We have to check that there is some "expansion" $\delta$ of $\Delta$ such that there is a "homomorphism" $\delta \homto \xi$. 
        We first guess a valuation $\mu :  \vars(\delta_{\textup{zip}}) \to \vars(\xi)$.
        Now it remains to check that:
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item For every "CRPQ" atom $x \atom{a^*} y$ of $\delta_{\textup{zip}}$ there is an $a$-path in $\xi$ from $\mu(x)$ to $\mu(y)$.
          \item Every "path-$l$ approximation" $\pathl(X, Y, \bigwedge_{1 \leq i \leq n} A_i(x_i,y_i))$ of $\delta_{\textup{zip}}$ contains a "CQ" $\delta_{\textup{path}}$  admitting a "path decomposition" of "width" $l$ which starts with the bag $X$ and ends with $Y$. And further, there is a homomorphism $h: \delta_{\textup{path}}  \homto \xi$ which coincides with $\mu$ on variables $X \cup Y$.
        \end{enumerate}
        Observe that  these two properties hold true if, and only if, there is some "expansion" $\delta$ of $\Delta$ such that $\delta \homto \gamma$.
        It is clear the first point can be achieved in polynomial time (actually, in "NL") since it is a simple reachability query. 
        The second point can also be achieved in polynomial time (or in "NL"), since the "fine" "path decomposition" of "width" $l$ can be guessed on-the-fly using $l+1$ pointers to the variables of $\gamma$ ("cf" \Cref{lemma:evaluation-bounded-pathwidth}). An "NL" algorithm can advance down the "path decomposition" while simultaneously
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item guessing the "conjunctive query" $\delta_{\textup{path}}$ via its "fine" "path decomposition" of "width" $k$,
          \item checking that there is a partial "homomorphism" to $\gamma$ ("ie", a "homomorphism" from the subquery of $\gamma$ restricted to current "bag"'s variables to $\gamma$),
          \item ensuring that the "CQ" $\delta_{\textup{path}}$ being built is an element of $\pathl(X, Y, \bigwedge_{1 \leq i \leq n} A_i(x_i,y_i))$, which requires to also guess a homomorphism $\rho \homto \delta_{\textup{path}}$ from a refinement $\rho$ of $\bigwedge_{1 \leq i \leq n} A_i(x_i,y_i)$.
        \end{enumerate}
        Further, a simple test can ensure that the first and last bags of the decomposition  coincide with the guessed assignment $\mu$.
        Since the number of pointers (bounded by $k+1$) is fixed, this subroutine is in "NL", and hence in polynomial time. This yields an "NP" algorithm for testing $\xi \contained \Qapp$.
  \end{proof}


  As a consequence of the two claims, we obtain a "SigmaP2"~algorithm for non-containment of $\gamma \contained \Qapp$: We first guess an "expansion" $\anexpansion$ of $\gamma$ of polynomial size, and we then test $\anexpansion \centernot{\contained} \Qapp$ in "coNP". This gives a {"PiP2"} algorithm for the "semantic tree-width $k$ problem", which is correct by
  \Cref{lemma:MUAk-union-of-polysized-summary-test-np,claim:poly-sized-counterexample-sre}.
\end{proof}
