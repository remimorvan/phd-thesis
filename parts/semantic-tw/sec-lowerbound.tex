\label{sec:lowerbound}

An "ExpSpace" lower bound follows by a straightforward adaptation from the
"ExpSpace" lower bound for the case $k=1$ \cite[Proposition 6.2]{BarceloRomeroVardi2016SemanticAcyclicity}.
\begin{restatable}[Lower bound of \Cref{thm:decidability-semtw}]{lemma}{lowerbound}
    \AP\label{lemma:lowerbound}
    For every $k\geq 1$, the following problems are "ExpSpace"-hard, even if restricted to "Boolean CRPQs":
	\begin{itemize}
		\item the "semantic tree-width $k$ problem";
		\item the "one-way semantic tree-width $k$ problem";
		\item the "semantic path-width $k$ problem";
		\item the "one-way semantic path-width $k$ problem".
	\end{itemize}
\end{restatable}

\AP We say that a "C2RPQ" is \reintro{connected} when its underlying undirected graph is connected.
We first give a small useful fact.

\begin{fact}[{Implicit in \cite[Proof of Proposition 6.2]{BarceloRomeroVardi2016SemanticAcyclicity}}]
    \AP\label{fact:connectedness}\leavevmode
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Let $G, G'$ be two "databases@@graph" and $\delta$ be a "connected" "Boolean" "C2RPQ".
            If the "disjoint union" $G \disunion G'$ "satisfies@@db" $\delta$, then either $G$ "satisfies@@db" $\delta$ or
            $G'$ "satisfies@@db" $\delta$.
        \item Let $\gamma,\delta$ be "Boolean" "C2RPQs". If $\delta$ is "connected"
            and $\gamma \contained \delta$, then there exists a "subquery" $\gamma'$ of $\gamma$,
            obtained as connected component of $\gamma$, such that
            $\gamma' \contained \delta$. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{fact}

Notice first that if $\gamma$ and $\delta$ are "CQs" then the proof of
\Cref{fact:connectedness} follows directly from the equivalence of $\gamma \contained \delta$ (resp.\ $G$ "satisfies@@db" $\gamma$) and the existence of a "homomorphism" from $\delta$ to $\gamma$ (resp.\ $\gamma$ to $G$).

\begin{proof}
	We first prove the second point.
    Write $\gamma \defeq \gamma_1 \land \dotsc \land \gamma_n$ where $\gamma_1,\dotsc,\gamma_n$
    are connected components of $\gamma$, and assume by contradiction that
    for all $i$, $\gamma_i \notcontained \delta$. Then there exists a database $G_i$
    such that $G_i$ "satisfies@@db" $\gamma_i$ but not $\delta$.
    Consider the disjoint union $G = G_1 \disunion \dotsc \disunion G_n$.

    On the one hand, since the $\gamma_i$'s have disjoint variables
    and $G_i$ "satisfies@@db" $\gamma_i$ for each $i$, then $G$ "satisfies@@db" $\gamma$.
    On the other hand, $G$ cannot "satisfy@@db" $\delta$:
    if there was a "homomorphism" from $\delta$ to $G$,
    since $\delta$ is connected, there would exist an index $i$
    such that $\delta$ is mapped on $G_i$, which would contradict the
    fact that $G_i$ does not "satisfy@@db" $\delta$.
    Hence, $G$ does not "satisfy@@db" $\delta$, which contradicts the containment
    $\gamma \contained \delta$.

	To prove the first point, we simply apply the second one, by letting $\gamma$
	be the conjunction of the canonical "CQ" associated with $G$ and $G'$---which
	is in fact the canonical "CQ" associated with $G\disunion G'$. From the assumption
    that $G \disunion G'$ "satisfies@@db" $\delta$ it follows that $\gamma \contained \delta$
    and so, by the first point, there is either a homomorphism from $\delta$
    to $G$ or from $\delta$ to $G'$.
\end{proof}

We can then prove \Cref{lemma:lowerbound}.

\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{lemma:lowerbound}]
    Fix $k \geq 1$. We focus on "semantic tree-width", but the exact same reduction works for the other three problems.
    We introduce an intermediate problem, called 
    the \AP""asymmetric containment problem for tree-width $k$"":
    given two "Boolean" "CRPQs" $\gamma$ and $\gamma'$,
    where $\gamma$ has "tree-width" $k$, $\gamma'$ is "connected"  
    and does \emph{not} have "semantic tree-width" $k$,
    it asks whether $\gamma \contained \gamma'$.
    The proof of the lemma then contains two parts:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item first, we reduce the "asymmetric containment problem for tree-width $k$"
            to the "semantic tree-width $k$ problem",
        \item then, we prove that the "asymmetric containment problem for tree-width $k$" is
            "ExpSpace"-hard.
    \end{enumerate}
    \proofcase{(1):} We reduce the instance $(\gamma, \gamma')$
    of the "asymmetric containment problem for tree-width $k$"
    to the instance $\gamma \land \gamma'$ of the "semantic tree-width $k$ problem". We simply have 
    to check that $\gamma \contained \gamma'$ if and only if 
    $\gamma \land \gamma'$ has "semantic tree-width" $k$. The left-to-right
    implication is straightforward since $\gamma \contained \gamma'$
    implies that $\gamma \land \gamma' \semequiv \gamma$ and $\gamma$ was assumed to
    have "tree-width" $k$.
    For the converse implication, if $\gamma \land \gamma' \semequiv \delta$
    where $\delta$ is a "UC2RPQ" of "tree-width" $k$ then write
    $\delta = \bigvee_{i=1}^n \delta_i$ where the $\delta_i$'s are "C2RPQs"
    and let $\delta_{i,1},\dotsc, \delta_{i,k_i}$ be the connected components
    of $\delta_i$.
    
    Since for each $i$ we have
    $\delta_i \contained \delta \semequiv \gamma \land \gamma' \contained \gamma'$, by 
    \Cref{fact:connectedness}, there exists $j_i$ such that
    $\delta_{i,j_i} \contained \gamma'$.
    Let $\delta' \defeq \bigvee_{i=1}^n \delta_{i,j_i}$ so that, by construction
    $\delta' \contained \gamma'$. However, note that $\delta'$ has "tree-width" at most $k$
    but $\gamma'$ was assumed not to have "semantic tree-width" $k$,
    hence $\delta' \strcontained \gamma'$,
    so there exists $G'$ such that:
    \begin{equation}
        \AP\label{eq:subquery-reduction}
        G' \text{ "satisfies@@db" } \gamma'
        \quad\text{ and }\quad
        G' \text{ does not "satisfy@@db" } \delta'.
    \end{equation}
    
    We now prove that $\gamma \contained \gamma'$. Let $G$ be a
    "database@@graph" "satisfying@@db" $\gamma$. Then the disjoint union $G \disunion G'$ "satisfies@@db" $\gamma \land \gamma'$
    since $G$ "satisfies@@db" $\gamma$, $G'$ "satisfies@@db" $\gamma'$ and $\gamma$ and $\gamma'$
    are Boolean so we can assume "wlog" that they have disjoint variables.
    As a consequence, $G \disunion G'$ "satisfies@@db" $\delta$ and hence $\delta'$,
    so there exists $i$ such that $G \disunion G'$ "satisfies@@db" $\delta_{i,j_i}$.
    Since $\delta_{i,j_i}$ is "connected", either $G$ "satisfies@@db"
    $\delta_{i,j_i}$ or $G'$ "satisfies@@db" $\delta_{i,j_i}$.
    By \Cref{eq:subquery-reduction}, the latter cannot hold,
    so $G$ "satisfies@@db" $\delta_{i,j_i}$ and hence $\gamma'$.

    Therefore, we have shown that for each "database@@graph" $G$ that "satisfies@@db" 
    $\gamma$, then $G$ "satisfies@@db" $\gamma'$, "ie", $\gamma \contained \gamma'$. Overall,
    $\gamma \land \gamma'$ has "semantic tree-width" $k$ if and only if
    $\gamma \contained \gamma'$.

    \medskip

    \proofcase{(2):}
    We now show that the "asymmetric containment problem for tree-width $k$" is
    "ExpSpace"-hard.
    It was shown in \cite[Lemma 8]{Figueira2020Containment} that
    the "containment" of "CRPQs" was still "ExpSpace"-hard
    when restricted to inputs of the form:
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=scriptsize]
            \gamma() = \qvar \rar["K"] & \qvar & \contained^{?} & 
            \qvar \rar["L_1", bend left=40] \rar["\raisebox{6pt}{\small\vdots}", phantom] \rar["L_p" below, bend right=40] & \qvar &[-2.1em] = \delta(),
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    where $K,L_1,\dotsc,L_p$ are regular languages over $\A$.
    We reduce it to the following problem:
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=scriptsize, row sep=tiny]
            & & & & & & \qvar \ar[dr, "\#"] \ar[dd, "\#" above left] & \\
            \gamma'() \defeq \qvar \rar["K"] & \qvar \arrow["\#" above, loop above] & \contained^{?} & 
            \qvar \rar["L_1", bend left=40] \rar["\raisebox{6pt}{\small\vdots}", phantom] \rar["L_p" below, bend right=40] & \qvar \rar["\A^*"] & \qvar \ar[rr, "\#" below right] \ar[ur, "\#"] \ar[dr, "\#" below left] & & \qvar = \delta'(). \\
            & & & & & & \qvar \ar[ur, "\#" below right]
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    where the right-hand side of $\delta'$ is a directed $(k+2)$-clique
    and where $\#$ is a new symbol, i.e. $\# \not\in \A$.

    We claim that $\gamma \contained \delta$ if and only if $\gamma' \contained \delta'$.
    The forward implication is direct and the converse implication
    simply relies on the fact that $\# \not\in \A$.\footnote{Indeed, the only possible "homomorphisms" from "expansions" of $\delta'$ to "expansions" of $\gamma'$ are the ones sending the "expansions" of "atoms" containing $L_1, \dotsc, L_p$ inside the "expansion" of the "atom" on $K$.}
    Then, observe that $\gamma'$ has "tree-width" $1 \leq k$,
    and that $\delta'$ is connected but do not have "semantic tree-width"
    at most $k$.
    
    To prove the last point, consider a "UC2RPQ" $\Delta''$ that is
    equivalent to $\delta'$. Pick any "expansion" $\xi'_1$ of $\delta'$.
    Since $\Delta'' \contained \delta'$, there exists
    an "expansion" $\xi''$ of $\Delta''$ such that there is a "homomorphism"
    from $\xi'_1$ to $\xi''$. Dually, since $\delta' \contained \Delta''$,
    there exists an "expansion" $\xi'_2$ of $\delta'$ such that there
    is a "homomorphism" from $\xi'' \to \xi'_2$. Overall, we have
    "homomorphisms" $\xi'_1 \to \xi'' \to \xi'_2$.
    Since $\xi'_1$ and $\xi'_2$ are both "expansions" of $\delta'$,
    they contain a $\#$-labelled directed $(k+2)$-clique,
    and the $\#$-letter appears nowhere else.
    Should the "homomorphism" $\xi'_1 \to \xi''$ not be injective,
    $\xi''$ would contain a $\#$-labelled self-loop,
    and hence, the "homomorphism" $\xi'' \to \xi'_2$ would
    yield a $\#$-self loop in $\xi'_2$, which does not exist!
    Hence, the "homomorphism" from $\xi'_1$ to $\xi''$
    is injective on the $(k+2)$-clique.
    As a result, $\xi''$ contains a $(k+2)$-clique
    and has "tree-width" at least $k+1$.
    We conclude that $\Delta''$ has "tree-width" at least $k+1$ by \Cref{fact:refinement-tw}, provided that $k \geq 2$.

    Hence, we have shown that $\gamma \contained \delta$ if and only if $\gamma' \contained \delta'$
    where $\gamma'$ has "tree-width" at most $k$, where $\delta'$ is "connected" and
    has "semantic tree-width" at least $k+1$. Since our reduction
    can be implemented in polynomial time, we conclude that the problems of
    \Cref{lemma:lowerbound} are "ExpSpace"-hard.
	% To deal with "path-width" and/or the case $k=1$,
	% it suffices to use the same trick as in \cite[Proposition 6.2]{BarceloRomeroVardi2016SemanticAcyclicity}: for instance one can add in $\delta'$ on the $i$-th variable of the $(k+2)$-clique a self-loop labelled by a new symbol $\$_i$, and add in $\gamma'$ a self-loop labelled by $\$_i$ on the variable that
	% already has a $\#$-self-loop.
\end{proof}
