We investigate the following decision problem: given two regular input languages of finite words, decide whether there exists a first-order definable separator. We prove that in order to answer this question, sufficient information can be extracted from semigroups recognizing the input languages, using a fixpoint computation. This yields an EXPTIME algorithm for checking first-order separability. Moreover, the correctness proof of this algorithm yields a stronger result, namely a description of a possible separator. Finally, we generalize this technique to answer the same question for regular languages of infinite words.},

A new ordering for categories, called division, is introduced which allows useful comparison of monoids and categories. Associated with every morphism ϕ: M → N is a category Dϕ, called the derived category of ϕ, which encodes the essential information about the morphism. The derived category is shown to be a rightful generalization of the kernel of a group morphism. Collections of categories that admit direct products and division are studied. Called varieties, these collections are shown to be completely determined by the path equations their members satisfy. Several important examples are discussed. In a major application, a strong connection is established between category varieties and certain semigroup varieties associated with recognizable languages.},

	abstract = {Rational word languages can be defined by several equivalent means: finite state automata, rational expressions, finite congruences, or monadic second-order (MSO) logic. The robust subclass of aperiodic languages is defined by: counter-free automata, star-free expressions, aperiodic (finite) congruences, or first-order (FO) logic. In particular, their algebraic characterization by aperiodic congruences allows to decide whether a regular language is aperiodic. We lift this decidability result to rational transductions, i.e., word-to-word functions defined by finite state transducers. In this context, logical and algebraic characterizations have also been proposed. Our main result is that one can decide if a rational transduction (given as a transducer) is in a given decidable congruence class. We also establish a transfer result from logic-algebra equivalences over languages to equivalences over transductions. As a consequence, it is decidable if a rational transduction is first-order definable, and we show that this problem is PSPACE-complete.},

This notion provides a basis for an algebraic study of transducers, and was integral to the characterization of the sequential transducers computable in some circuit complexity classes. Here, we report on the decidability of continuity for functional transducers and some standard classes of regular languages. To this end, we develop a robust theory rooted in the standard profinite analysis of regular languages. Since previous algebraic studies of transducers have focused on the sole structure of the underlying input automaton, we also compare the two algebraic approaches. We focus on two questions: When are the automaton structure and the continuity properties related, and when does continuity propagate to superclasses?},

	abstract = {Cette thèse traite des langages reconnaissables de mots indexés par des ordinaux.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}{\textless}br /{\textgreater}Plusieurs classes d'automates qui reconnaissent de tels mots ont été introduites par Büchi. Elles diffèrent par la longueur des mots reconnus par les automates. Nous en utilisons quatre: la classe pour les mots de longueur [\$\omega\$] , celle pour les mots de longueur inférieure à [\$\omega{\textasciicircum}(n+1)\$] , où n est un entier naturel, celle pour les mots de longueur dénombrable, et celle pour les mots de longueur quelconque. Nous y ajoutons la classe des automates de Kleene traditionnelle, sur les mots finis. Nous remontrons que ces différentes définitions d'automates sont équivalentes, c'est-à-dire que données deux de ces classes et un automate d'une des deux, la restriction du langage reconnu par l'automate aux mots du domaine le plus petit des deux classes est la restriction du langage reconnu par un automate de l'autre classe au même domaine. Nous donnons également une présentation unifiée de la déterminisation pour chacune des classes qui reconnaît au plus des mots de longueur dénombrable.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}{\textless}br /{\textgreater}Les semigroupes finis sont un formalisme équivalent aux automates pour définir des ensembles de mots finis. Perrin, Pin et Wilke ont introduits des structures algébriques adaptées à l'étude des langages de mots de longueur [\$\omega\$] , qui, quand elles sont finies, sont équivalentes aux automates. Nous généralisons l'approche algébrique de la théorie des langages reconnaissables de mots de longueur [\$\omega\$] aux mots de longueur inférieure à [\$\omega{\textasciicircum}(n+1)\$] , puis aux mots de longueur dénombrable. Pour cela, nous définissons deux structures algébriques, les [\$\omega{\textasciicircum}n\$] -semigroupes et les [\$\omega\_1\$] -semigroupes, qui, quand elles sont finies, sont équivalentes respectivement aux automates pour les mots de longueur inférieure à [\$\omega{\textasciicircum}(n+1)\$] et aux automates pour les mots de longueur dénombrable. Comme pour le cas des mots de longueur [\$\omega\$] , une algèbre syntaxique peut être canoniquement associée à chaque langage reconnaissable. Nous définissons le produit de Schützenberger et le produit en couronne sur les [\$\omega\_1\$] -semigroupes. Nous étendons également le théorème des variétés d'Eilenberg aux mots de longueur dénombrable.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}{\textless}br /{\textgreater}Finalement, nous remontrons l'équivalence entre langages reconnus par automates et langages définis par énoncés de logique monadique du second ordre quand on s'intéresse aux mots de longueur dénombrable. Le théorème d'équivalence de Schützenberger entre langages sans étoile et semigroupes finis apériodiques est étendu aux mots de longueur inférieure à [\$\omega{\textasciicircum}(n+1)\$] , et le théorème d'équivalence entre langages sans étoile et langages définis par énoncés de logique du premier ordre de l'ordre linéaire de McNaughton et Papert est étendu aux mots de longueur quelconque.},

The algebraic structure used, called an Ω1-semigroup, is an adaptation of the one used in the theory of regular languages of Ω-words. We show that finite Ω1-semigroups are equivalent to automata. In particular, the proof gives a new algorithm for determinizing automata on countable ordinals. As in the cases of finite and Ω-words, a syntactic Ω1-semigroup can effectively be associated with any regular language of words on countable ordinals. This result is used to prove an Eilenberg type theorem. There is a one-to-one correspondence between varieties of Ω1-languages and pseudo-varieties of Ω1-semigroups.},

By suitable choices of these categories our result uniformly covers Eilenberg's theorem and three variants due to Pin, Polák and Reutenauer, respectively, and yields new Eilenberg-type correspondences.},

	abstract   = {For many problems arising in the setting of graph querying (such as finding semantic associations in RDF graphs, exact and approximate pattern matching, sequence alignment, etc.), the power of standard languages such as the widely studied conjunctive regular path queries (CRPQs) is insufficient in at least two ways. First, they cannot output paths and second, more crucially, they cannot express relationships among paths.We thus propose a class of extended CRPQs, called ECRPQs, which add regular relations on tuples of paths, and allow path variables in the heads of queries. We provide several examples of their usefulness in querying graph structured data, and study their properties. We analyze query evaluation and representation of tuples of paths in the output by means of automata. We present a detailed analysis of data and combined complexity of queries, and consider restrictions that lower the complexity of ECRPQs to that of relational conjunctive queries. We study the containment problem, and look at further extensions with first-order features, and with nonregular relations that add arithmetic constraints on the lengths of paths and numbers of occurrences of labels.},
