We study the problem of querying graph databases, and, in particular, the expressiveness and complexity of evaluation for several general-purpose query languages, such as the regular path queries and its extensions with conjunctions and inverses. We distinguish between two semantics for these languages. The first one, based on simple paths, easily leads to intractability, while the second one, based on arbitrary paths, allows tractable evaluation for an expressive family of languages.We also study two recent extensions of these languages that have been motivated by modern applications of graph databases. The first one allows to treat paths as first-class citizens, while the second one permits to express queries that combine the topology of the graph with its underlying data.},

Such algorithms, linear in the size of the graph but exponential or superexponential in k, exist for most NP-hard problems that have linear time algorithms for trees. The examples used are optimization problems involving independent sets, dominating sets, graph coloring, Hamiltonian circuits, network reliability and minimum vertex deletion forbidden subgraphs. The results generalize previous results for series-parallel graphs, bandwidth-constrained graphs, and non- serial dynamic programming.}

	abstract = {We consider the problems of conjunctive query containment and minimization, which are known to be NP-complete, and show that these problems can be solved in polynomial time for the class of acyclic queries. We then generalize the notion of acyclicity and define a parameter called query width that captures the “degree of cyclicity” of a query: in particular, a query is acyclic if and only if its query width is 1. We give algorithms for containment and minimization that run in time polynomial in nk, where n is the input size and k is the query width. These algorithms naturally generalize those for acyclic queries, and are of practical significance because many queries have small query width compared to their sizes. We show that good bounds on the query width of Q can be obtained using the treewidth of the incidence graph of Q. We then consider the problem of finding an equivalent query to a given conjunctive query Q that has the least number of subgoals. We show that a polynomial-time approximation algorithm is unlikely for this problem. Finally, we apply our containment algorithm to the practically important problem of finding equivalent rewritings of a query using a set of materialized views.}
